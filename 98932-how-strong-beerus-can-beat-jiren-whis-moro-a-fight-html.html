Can he beat Jiren, Whis, Moro in a fight?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-16</div><p class=align-left><strong>Every Dragon Ball series has its God of Destruction, and Beerus is the universe's seventh God of Destruction. He destroys both the planet and those dwelling there with his power. At the same time, he can eradicate the entire solar system with ease. Because of this special ability, there is a question many of the series' fans have been asking. So, how strong is Beerus?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5faca2b0acd68893.jpg><p class=align-left>The God of Destruction once eradicated a planet using a tiny bit of energy drop from his finger to the surface. Even after suppressing his power, he dominated Goku in battle and became unconscious with just a soft jab in the neck. Being a God of Destruction, his responsibility is to maintain balance in the universe.</p><h2>Who is Beerus in Dragon Ball Z?</h2><p class=align-left>Beerus is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">primary antagonist </a>of the<i> Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</i> film and the <i>God of Destruction Beerus Saga</i>. Also, he is the God of Destruction of Universe 7 and has Champa as his twin brother. Champa is the God of Destruction of Universe 6.</p><p class=align-left>Was Beerus born a god? He was not born into divinity but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earned his position</a> as a destroyer. After proving his strength, he was granted the power of destruction to help maintain balance in the universe. However, before his creation as a character, Beerus was first referenced in the manga chapter of <i>The Zeta Sword</i> and <i>Out From the Broken Sword </i>episode as the one who sealed Old Kai in the Z Sword. He is escorted by his martial arts tutor and attendant, Whis.</p><p class=align-left>Initially, the scriptwriter anticipated Beerus as a villain character that affects people with evil. Later, he became a supporting character in the following sagas. The amazing character's behaviour is similar to most cats, which he displays in his love for long sleep sessions.</p><p class=align-left>When he awakes, he is found in a bad mood, and once he becomes more awake, he becomes less touchy. As most cats do, he enjoys dominating and claiming his desires without putting others into consideration.</p><h2>How strong is Beerus at full power?</h2><p class=align-left>Beerus' <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">power level</a> is around three billion at 100%. Interestingly, although he appeared to be powerful, at some point, whether he has more power than Goku and Vegeta combined became an issue of concern. Nevertheless, after beating Goku without using all of his power, it became apparent that the God of Destruction is strong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e684613d0cd93a94.jpg><p class=align-left>Among most gods in the universe, Beerus seems to be one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">most feared</a>. The likes of Kais, King Vegeta, King Cold, Frieza, Supreme Kais, Cooler, Vegeta, and even Shenron, fear him. The God of Destruction is the second strongest fighter in the universe from the Dragon Ball Super's final saga. Because of his power, he destroys important planets without thinking twice, and the moment it becomes a concern, he uses someone else as a destruction agent.</p><h2>How strong is Beerus compared to Goku?</h2><p class=align-left>When the God of Destruction first fought with Goku, he used a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">minute part</a> of his total power. However, since Goku achieved Ultra Instinct, the gap has been reduced. So, is anyone stronger than Beerus? The answer to this is still debatable as he reportedly possesses some special attacks, including Sphere of Destruction and Destruction before Creation.</p><p class=align-left>Notwithstanding, as the story continues, Goku and the God of Destruction gap becomes smaller after their fight. So when trying to compare how strong this God of Destruction is, it is essential to compare him to Goku. Goku learned a new transformation in Super Saiyan Blue, which is often stronger than god's form. After getting a further boost by mixing in Kao Ken, when Goku uses Ultra Instinct, he can beat Jiren. Because of this, he is considered close to Beerus in power.</p><h2>How strong is Beerus in the manga?</h2><p class=align-left>The God of Destruction in the manga is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">top two</a> amongst all the gods. He and Quitela were the last people standing during a God battle royale they did to entertain Zeno. Beerus also had the feat of shaking the universe when clashing fists with Goku, unlike the other anime.</p><p class=align-left>So, how strong is Beerus compared to other gods? Although the Dragon Ball franchise is known for its many gods, not all of them are as strong as the God of Destruction. <a href=#>The series</a> has developed a fantastic structure of deities in its dense <a href=#>world</a>, which hold immense powers capable of obliterating universes. It seems that the power of these gods grows each time, but only a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">little of their power</a> stands close to Beerusâ€™.</p><p class=align-left>This <a href=#>special character</a> can swat opponents with the flick of a finger and even destroy planets with his fingers. A good example was when the power dropped from his finger to the surface and obliterated a planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/71c7ab51a51ffdb7.jpg><h3>Can Beerus beat Moro?</h3><p class=align-left>Beerus <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">can beat</a> Moro. It is said that Beerus is very strong and can destroy the whole solar system with little effort. After eliminating a whole planet with a minute bit of his energy, his power did not diminish. Rather, he still dominated Super Saiyan 3 Goku in battle and rendered him unconscious with just a light chop to the neck.</p><h3>Who is Beerus strongest opponent?</h3><p class=align-left>Beerus is the most powerful destruction god that even the Supreme Kai and King Kai are afraid of. Apart from fighting Goku to fulfil a prophecy, the other stronger and more powerful fighters that the God of Destruction has are his mentors, Whiz and Zen-oh.</p><p class=align-left>Whis trained Beerus, which automatically means that Beerus could not be more powerful than him. Although Whis once noted that a Universe exists, which <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">harbours a mortal being</a> that is more powerful than the God of Destruction, the truth has not been validated in <a href=#>the series</a> yet.</p><p class=align-left>In a nutshell, how strong is Beerus? With a power level of around three billion at 100%, he is a king in all sense. It only takes a moment for him to destroy anything and everything, and it just takes a thought to remove something from existence altogether. There seems to be nothing more potent than this destruction god yet.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>10 best legal anime download sites in South Africa</a></p><p class=align-left>Do you love watching anime shows and considering where to download different <a href=#>series</a>? <a href=#>We</a> shared some legal websites where you can <a href=#>download anime movies</a> with interesting storylines.
