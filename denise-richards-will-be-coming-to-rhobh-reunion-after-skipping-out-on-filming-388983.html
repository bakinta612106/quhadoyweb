I’m planning on going if we still have [it]. I don’t know how we’re going to be doing the reunion now. Maybe things will be lifted and we’ll be able to do it, even if it’s on Zoom. But I never said that I wasn’t going to be there. They’re the ones that are saying that.’</p><p>As far as the leaks go, Denise is questioning why those like Glanville is letting the drama spill off-screen.</p><p>‘I look at things a little differently.
