Cobra Kai returns with Season 5, only on Netflix Sept. 9. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0auoaVsnX8</a></p><p>— Cobra Kai (@CobraKaiSeries) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 16, 2022</a></p><h2>What role does Alicia Hannah-Kim play in Cobra Kai Season 5?</h2><p>Alicia Hannah-Kim is a well-known Australian actress who was born and raised in Sydney. She started her acting career with the ATYP national youth theatre group. She then made her television debut in the highly praised show White Collar Blue. She made her US debut with Crash after cementing her grasp on the Australian entertainment sector.&nbsp;She went on to star in the famous US Network program Grey’s Anatomy, as well as Two and a Half Men, Hot in Cleveland, Supah Ninjas, Chasing Life, and Hawaii Five-O. She earned the character of Kim Da-Eun in Netflix’s big hit series, Cobra Kai, after a few more appearances and recurring roles.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Alicia-Hannah-2.jpg alt="Alicia Hannah" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the next season, Kim Da-Eun will play a significant part in Silver’s group’s growth in the valley. This will be the season’s primary dilemma, particularly with Johnny Lawrence out of the way, after the devastating defeat in the previous season’s conclusion. Daniel LaRusso looks to be willing to raise a commotion in order to undermine Terry Silver’s intentions.&nbsp;Kim is the granddaughter of Silver and Kreese’s sensei, Kim Sun-Yun, as well as a talented sensei. Many new senseis will be introduced, but Kim Da-Eun may stand out owing to her participation in the show’s teasers. She will also serve as a foil to Chozen (Yuji Okumoto), who will represent the lineage of Miyagi-genetic Do.</p><p>According to one idea, Kim Da-Eun will take Cobra Kai away from Silver, prolonging the cycle of hate and treachery. Kreese (Martin Kove) had previously stolen Johnny’s organization, and Silver had stolen Kreese’s. Kim may continue to do so if she is enlisted into the ranks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Alicia-Hannah-1.jpg alt="Alicia Hannah" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>When will Cobra Kai be available on Netflix?</h2><p>The first 10 episodes of the drama series will be available on Netflix on Friday, September 9, 2022, at 3 a.m. EST.
