I don’t think NeNe should be on the next season.’</p><p>A fan wanted more peace for the show and said: ‘I wished everyone would leave Nene alone. I wished you guys would get along. Instead of fighting for ratings.’</p><p>One other follower posted this: ‘Y’all could have kept this 3rd part…and Yo Yo came to show her new teeth Because she lacked receipts,’ and someone else wrote: ‘I love when NeNe called in and Andy was like we’ll talk to you later.’</p><p>A follower had this idea: ‘Invite Porsha to speak on it. You two had similar takes on Snakegate and seemed to be in a much better place than in years past.’</p><p>One other fan told the RHOA star: ‘Kandi I agree with you nene does all this talking and couldn’t face her own music, and I still think Yovanna was lying.’</p><p>Someone else told Kandi that they did not understand why NeNe didn’t want to be on the third part of the Virtual Reunion: ‘Kandi I really didn’t understand why NeNe didn’t show up tonight.’</p><p>A follower agreed and said: ‘I was left confused as well! Love you though!
