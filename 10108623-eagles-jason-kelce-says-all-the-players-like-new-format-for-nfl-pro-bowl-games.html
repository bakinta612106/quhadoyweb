In addition to playing in the game, Kelce competed in the "Snapshot" long-snapping drill and participated in the Gridiron Gauntlet.</p><p>"If the people on the field are having fun, the audience is having fun, and I think it was evident throughout the week that guys really enjoyed doing the different games and activities," Kelce said.

His brother was also selected to the showcase for the ninth straight year, but he's gearing up to lead the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>There's a chance that this was Kelce's final Pro Bowl, as there was speculation after the Eagles' playoff loss that he was ending his NFL career even though he has yet to officially announce his retirement. Still, he believes the Pro Bowl has a bright future under the new format.</p><p>"They've done a good job of incorporating all that stuff, and I think it's only gonna get better as they continue to do it in future years and come up with new things," he said.
