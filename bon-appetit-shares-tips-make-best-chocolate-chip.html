Whereas if you were to add more white sugar you would wind up with a crispier cookie.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Butter<br></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Before you add butter to the mix, always remember to soften it first to room temperature. Trying to mix cold butter into a dough is no fun!</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Softening the butter not only makes it easier to cream together with the other ingredients, but it also makes for a better cookie flavor and texture.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">For a thicker, denser cookie, use melted or browned butter. We like to mix brown butter in with softened butter to get a chewy dense cookie, but with crisp edges (best of both worlds!). Plus, that incredible caramel, nutty brown butter flavor.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">If you like a thin and crispy cookie … use more granulated sugar and more butter.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">If you like more thick and chunky cookie … use more brown sugar and browned or melted butter.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">If you like caky cookies, you can add about 10% more flour as well.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">You Can Skip the Chocolate Chips</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Don’t limit yourself to packaged chocolate chips. If you want to make the ultimate chocolate chip cookies, then it's time to step out of the box (or bag!) a bit and cut your own chocolate.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Cut the chocolate yourself using a serrated knife, and don't worry about getting pieces of exactly the same size.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Using chopped chocolate not only tastes superior, but it will give the cookies a great texture. The bigger chunks will give your cookies those great pools of chocolate and the smaller pieces and shavings will give you flecks of chocolate throughout the whole cookie.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Plus, you can even get creative with it and use different types of chocolate!</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bittersweet, dark-dark, semi-sweet and milk chocolate all have their own unique flavor that pairs beautifully when added together.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Once you sink your teeth into a warm, chewy cookie with chunks of perfect chocolate, you'll never use chips again.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">Use an Ice Cream Scoop</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Have you ever noticed that when you don't shape the dough and simply plopped each dollop down that some wind up more crisp on the outside or under-cooked in the middle? That's because they are all different sizes.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">While varying sizes can look great, they don't all cook evenly on the sheet pan, which is what causes them to be cooked with varying results even though they were baked in the same batch.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">By using a cookie scoop or shaping dough into relatively the same size by hand, the cookies will get a more uniform shape -- and bake evenly no matter where they’re placed on the pan.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Unless you like doughy middles and burnt edges, use an ice cream scoop to portion out your dough so the cookies bake to perfection.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">Double the recipe and pop extras in the freezer</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">We believe that you should always have some cookie dough in your freezer to have on hand if a guest comes over or if you just want a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">When making cookies from scratch, you should make enough dough to portion out extras and pop them in the freezer. When you want a batch (or even just one cookie!), take a portioned ball of cookie dough out of the freezer and pop it in the oven, just keep an eye on the cook time to go a few minutes longer.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR"><a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>BA's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies</a></h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bon Appetit senior food editor Chris Morrocco developed the "BA's best" recipe for perfect chocolate chip cookies.
