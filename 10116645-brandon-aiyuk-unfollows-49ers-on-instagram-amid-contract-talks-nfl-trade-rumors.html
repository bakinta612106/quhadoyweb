Brandon Aiyuk has unfollowed the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/49ers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#49ers&lt;/a> on Instagram. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hzVRLXRZeF">pic.twitter.com/hzVRLXRZeF&lt;/a></p><p>Aiyuk, who will be in the final season of a four-year, $12.53 million deal in 2024, has put pressure on San Francisco to offer him a more lucrative deal after an outstanding 2023 season. A contract extension has not come yet, and Aiyuk clearly seems frustrated.</p><p>Aiyuk, 26, is coming off the best season of his career, racking up 1,342 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. The former 25th pick in the 2020 draft believes he's worth more than his current deal, and it could lead to more tension if an extension can't get done soon.</p><p>Aiyuk could play on a fifth-year option if a deal can't get done, but he likely would prefer a new contract. There has also been buzz about the 49ers parting ways with Aiyuk in a trade, though general manager <a href=#>John Lynch said</a> in March that the team had not entered trade discussions.</p><p>A few weeks ago, Aiyuk indicated his current deal isn't fitting in his eyes. In an interview on the<i> Nightcap</i> podcast (h/t Yahoo Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Ian Casselberry</a>), Aiyuk spoke candidly about getting paid this offseason.</p><p>"I'm trying to get what I deserve," Aiyuk said. "I feel like this season, this season playing football, I figured out who I was as a person and a player, what I bring to the table, what I bring to the locker room, what I bring to the organization. And just the value I hold when I walk in that building."</p><p>The 49ers have a history of rewarding their stars, giving tight end George Kittle (2020), linebacker Fred Warner (2021), wide receiver Deebo Samuel (2022) and defensive end Nick Bosa (2023) respectable extensions after tremendous seasons.</p><p>Those deals didn't come without challenges, though, as the 49ers had to manage <a href=# rel=noopener>a trade request</a> from Samuel and Bosa <a href=# rel=noopener>holding out</a> in preseason, but they were able to get them done eventually. If Aiyuk is patient, San Francisco could reward him soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuDdYGMm6mappSku26tyLKspGWlo7OwuMuorqxlZG6ys7%2BMqKVmoZ6owaKz0ZqkZpmdnrFur86nq6uZk6l6ta3LpKpmppaherW%2BwJ2cZqqloryzvw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
