Quarterback Matthew Stafford has taken nine sacks and thrown more interceptions (five) than touchdowns (four) through three contests.</p><p>With his pick, Moton focused on the 49ers defense and the Rams’ tendency to turn the ball over.</p><p>“Don’t let the Rams' 2-1 record fool you," he said. "They beat a pair of 1-2 squads in the Atlanta Falcons and the Arizona Cardinals. The Rams have made plenty of mistakes, which will cost them in a division matchup against a Niners team with a top-three defense in both points and yards allowed.</p><p>“Last year, the 49ers pummeled Stafford in the pocket and took away the ball. In <a href=# rel=noopener>three games</a> against San Francisco, including the playoffs, the Rams signal-caller took nine sacks and threw for six touchdowns along with five interceptions. We could see his pattern of hardships continue because Los Angeles has committed seven turnovers this season, and Stafford lost two starting offensive linemen from last season in left tackle Andrew Whitworth (retired) and guard Austin Corbett (via free agency). Center Brian Allen hasn’t played since Week 1 as he recovers from a <a href=# rel=noopener>cleanout procedure</a> on his knee.</p><p>“Though Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald may ravage the 49ers’ new-look offensive line without star left tackle Trent Williams (high ankle sprain), 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan knows how to mask issues in the trenches with his ground attack, which ranks sixth in yards gained.”</p><p>Most of our crew pushed back on Moton, though.</p><p>In his analysis, he did mention the 49ers’ offensive line, which will feature Mike McGlinchey as the only holdover from last year’s starting unit. But after quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s subpar performance against the Denver Broncos, during which he stepped out bounds for a safety, we gave the consensus nod to the Rams.</p><p><b>Predictions</b></p><p>Davenport: 49ers</p><p>Ivory: 49ers</p><p>Kenyon: Rams</p><p>Knox: Rams</p><p>Moton: 49ers</p><p>O’Donnell: Rams</p><p>Sobleski: Rams</p><p><b>Consensus</b>: Rams +2</p><p><b>Score Prediction: Rams 26, 49ers 23</b></p><p><i>Gambling problem?
