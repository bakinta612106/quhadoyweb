More than a year after <a href=#>Michael Bublé</a> announced that his four-year-old son, Noah, with <a href=#>wife Luisana Lopilato</a> is battling <a href=#>cancer</a>, sources tell <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> that the little boy is doing "very well."</p><p>"He's an energetic little boy!" the insider revealed. "Events like this put everything in perspective… There's no doubt Christmas will be extra special at the Bublé household this year."</p><p>The source continued, "This time last year, the holidays were a tense time for the Bublé family. When Noah received a cancer diagnosis, Michael immediately made the decision to step away from his work. It was really a scary time for everyone."</p><p>The singer previously announced Noah's diagnosis in early November 2016. "We are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah who is currently undergoing treatment in the US," a statement on the singer's <a href=#>Facebook page</a> read at the time. "We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children." The couple never specified what type of cancer Noah suffered from. They also have a <a href=#>23-month-old son named Elias</a>.</p><p>The 42-year-old continued, "Luisana and I have put our careers on hold in order to devote all our time and attention to helping Noah get well. At this difficult time, we ask only for your prayers and respect for our privacy. We have a long journey in front of us and hope that with the support of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing." In February it was revealed that <a href=#>Luisana would return to work</a> amid her son's battle.</p><p>Just days before that news, Michael <a href=#>shared an update on Noah</a> with fans. "We are so grateful to report that our son Noah has been progressing well during his treatment and the doctors are very optimistic about the future for our little boy. He has been brave throughout and we continue to be inspired by his courage," the statement read at the time. "We thank God for the strength he has given all of us. Our gratitude to his doctors and caretakers cannot be put into words."</p><p>Today, Michael is also "in a really good head space right now" after taking a year off to focus on his son's health. He even has some exciting projects planned for 2018. We're so glad all the Bublé's are doing well just in time for the holidays!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8yimqGZlaF6o8HBpZxmr5mbsm680Z6ep5meqXqjrcGyZKynnqS0s63MZqehp6Skend%2FlGls</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
