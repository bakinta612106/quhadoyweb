The singer is famous for his hit tracks “Albachiara” and “Siamo Solo Noi” and also for his 10-times Platinum album Gli Spari Sopra, this Italian composer and singer composed more than 300 songs and released more than thirty albums between 1977 and 2015.</p><p>He is a close friend of the fellow Italian pop star&nbsp;He is a contemporary of fellow Italian pop singer <a href=#>Gianni Morandi</a>…</p><p>Encouraged by his friend Gaetano Curreri (now leading member of Italian rock band Stadio), Rossi released his first EP on 13 June 1977, which included the songs “Jenny è pazza” (Jenny is crazy) and “Silvia”, and a full-length album in 1978, Ma cosa vuoi che sia una canzone (“What do you think a song is”). In 1979, he released a second album, Non siamo mica gli americani (“We’re not at all the Americans”), which included, “Albachiara” (“Cleardawn”), one of his biggest hits, a ballad considered emblematic of Rossi’s poetic style. His most controversial album, Colpa d’Alfredo (“Alfredo’s fault”) followed in 1980; its title-track was censored from the radio and let loose bitter criticism because it contained some lyrics referring to women considered too explicit at that time. The controversy actually increased Rossi’s popularity, and he quickly saw himself famous on a national level, particularly after performing live on Domenica In, a popular Italian television program. The performance did not particularly please journalist Nantas Salvalaggio, who published a scathing article against Rossi calling him a drug addict. Rossi argued that Salvalaggio evidently did not understand his music and remarked how easy it is to criticize a still unknown artist who cannot defend himself.</p><p>In 1981, the album Siamo solo noi (“It’s only us”) was released.

The following album, Bollicine (“Little Bubbles”), published in 1983, was his sixth in seven years, and was the album that consecrated him definitively as an idol of the new generation and an icon of Italian rock.
