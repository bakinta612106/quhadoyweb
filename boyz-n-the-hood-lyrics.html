id=Verse_1>Verse 1</span></h4><p>Cruisin’ down the street in my 6-4<br>Jockin’ the freaks, clockin’ the dough<br>Went to the park to get the scoop<br>Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin’ some hoops<br>A car pulls up, who can it be?<br>A fresh El Camino rollin’ Kilo G<br>He rolled down his window and he started to say<br>It’s all about makin’ that GTA</p><h4><span id=Chorus>Chorus</span></h4><p>‘Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br>You come talkin’ the trash, we’ll pull your card<br>Knowin’ nothin’ in life, but to be legit<br>Don’t quote me, boy, ’cause I ain’t said shit</p><h4><span id=Scratches>Scratches</span></h4><p>Yo, man!<br>Get the fuck out!<br>Pump that bass!<br>Mothafucker, say what?</p><h4><span id=Verse_2>Verse 2</span></h4><p>Donald B’s in the place to give me the pace<br>He said my man JD is on freebase<br>The boy JD was a friend of mine<br>‘Til I caught him in my car tryin’ to steal an Alpine<br>Chased him up the streets to call a truce<br>The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce<br>Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge<br>One sucka dead, LA Times front page</p><h4><span id=Chorus1>Chorus</span></h4><p>‘Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br>You come talkin’ the trash, we’ll pull your card<br>Knowin’ nothin’ in life, but to be legit<br>Don’t quote me, boy,

I wanna get ill<br>So I went to a place where my homeboys chill<br>The fellas out there makin’ that dollar<br>I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala<br>They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin’<br>And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin’<br>Left to get my girl to rock that body<br>Before I left I hit the Bacardi<br>Went to her house to get her out of the pad<br>Dumb ho said somethin’ that made me mad<br>She said somethin’ that I couldn’t believe<br>So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave<br>She started talkin’ shit, wouldn’t you know?<br>Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho<br>Her father jumped up and he started to shout<br>So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out</p><h4><span id=Chorus2>Chorus</span></h4><p>‘Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br>You come talkin’ the trash, we’ll pull your card<br>Knowin’ nothin’ in life, but to be legit<br>Don’t quote me, boy, ’cause I ain’t said shit</p><h4><span id=Scratches2>Scratches</span></h4><p>Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?<br>Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way</p><h4><span id=Verse_4>Verse 4</span></h4><p>I’m rollin’ hard, now I’m under control<br>Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole<br>I looked at my car and I said “Oh, brother.”<br>I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another<br>Walkin’ home, I see the G ride<br>Now Cat is drivin’, Kilo on the side<br>As they busted a U, they got pulled over<br>An undercover cop in a dark green Nova<br>Cat got beat for resistin’ arrest<br>He socked the pig in the head for rippin’ his Guess<br>Now G is caught for doin’ the crime<br>Fourth offense on the boy he’ll do some time</p><h4><span id=Chorus3>Chorus</span></h4><p>‘Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br>You come talkin’ the trash, we’ll pull your card<br>Knowin’ nothin’ in life, but to be legit<br>Don’t quote me, boy, ’cause I ain’t said shit<br>[Scratches]<br>L.A. playa<br>Big Drum Beater</p><h4><span id=Verse_5>Verse 5</span></h4><p>I went to get them out, but there was no bail<br>The fellas causin’ a riot in the county jail<br>Two days later in the municipal court<br>Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart<br>“Disruption of the court,” said the judge<br>On a six-year sentence, my man didn’t budge<br>Baliff came over to turn him in<br>Kilo G looked up and gave a grin<br>He yelled out “Fire!”, then came Suzy<br>The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi<br>Police shot the girl but didn’t hurt her<br>Both upstate for attempted murder</p><h4><span id=Chorus4>Chorus</span></h4><p>‘Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br>You come talkin’ the trash, we’ll pull your card<br>Knowin’ nothin’ in life, but to be legit<br>Don’t quote me, boy, ’cause I ain’t said shit</p><p>[Scratches]<br>Get busy, y’all!<br>Aw<br>You
