On Wednesday evening, reporters caught Madonna and FKA Twigs as the girlfriends made their way from the Twenty Two Hotel in high spirits to the celebrity’s favorite spot on the map of London – the Chiltern Firehouse, Andre Balages’ luxury restaurant in Marylebone.
The ageless pop diva went to have fun in a white translucent mini-dress with a corset bodice and amusing ladybugs embroidered along the hem."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Both singers know a lot about parties and outrageous outfits.</p><p>On Wednesday evening, reporters caught Madonna and FKA Twigs as the girlfriends made their way from the Twenty Two Hotel in high spirits to the celebrity’s favorite spot on the map of London – the Chiltern Firehouse, Andre Balages’ luxury restaurant in Marylebone.</p><p>The ageless pop diva went to have fun in a white translucent mini-dress with a corset bodice and amusing ladybugs embroidered along the hem. The frivolous outfit was complemented by an oversized jacket, fishnet tights, heavy black boots, red leather mittens, and lots of jewelry. Her friend, with whom Madonna held hands tightly, preferred mini-shorts, a hoodie with a bright appliqué, an ethnic-style coat, and a fiery-colored bandana to go out.</p><p>Paparazzi shots suggest the two met the night before when Madonna took a front-row seat at a fashion show put on by students at Central Saint Martins in London. The singer arrived at the show as the mother of a future graduate: Madonna’s son Rocco is studying at the Central College of Art and Design. It was there that she was joined by the former girlfriend of Robert Pattinson – singer FKA Twigs, like Madonna, known for her love of custom outfits.</p><p>On that day, the star chose a stylish rocker outfit for publication: a leather jacket with rivet decor, a black floor-length dress made of black satin, and all the same brutal boots. An interesting point of the outfit was a voluminous bag in the form of a boombox made of black leather. Madonna’s blond locks were braided into her adorable 00s-style barrette-style pigtails, showing off the 63-year-old star’s surprisingly fresh complexion.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Remember that Madonna recently released a candid NFT to the public, on which she performed labor pains as a woman, thanks to which trees, butterflies, and centipede robots are born. In an interview with Mike Winkleman, the digital artist who created provocative NFTs, the singer explained that she gives birth to art and creativity.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedlrGwus2aZKKmXZZ6p7jIqaeapqRiuqq6yGafmqtdm8KvecinZKWnnpm8r3nWoquhZZantqa6w2adpJldqcSqs9JmbGtpZ2yAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
