The idea was followed by a touching remark about his beloved’s 25th birthday. I’d want to wish Champion a happy birthday.

Schwarzenegger confirmed the news in March 2016, when he made their relationship public on Instagram by uploading a picture of himself with Champion on his account. Champion has supposedly been dating Schwarzenegger for six years and is extremely close to the Schwarzenegger family. Schwarzenegger uploaded a photo of the couple smiling with a cake they cooked for a family meal with his parents and brothers on Easter 2020.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Abby-Champion-3.jpg alt="Abby Champion" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Patrick Schwarzenegger’s long-term girlfriend, Abby Champion</h2><p>Abby Champion is a model whose parents are Gregory and Laura Champion.
