He will only be able to negotiate a signing bonus, and even that would be somewhat limited by international bonus pool restrictions.</p><p>What's more, his NPB team wouldn't receive the same type of compensation as usual when a player is posted for a jump to MLB.</p><p>While that figures to create more of an open market where the big-spending teams aren't the only ones legitimately interested in signing Sasaki, he will likely have his pick of suitors. With money not as much of a factor, that could give contenders who would give him an immediate opportunity to compete for a World Series something of an advantage in discussions.</p><p>Any team would be more of a contender if he was on the roster.</p><p>Across <a href=# rel=noopener>all levels</a> to this point, Sasaki has a 1.94 ERA, 0.86 WHIP and 456 strikeouts in 375.1 innings. He throws his fastball at 103 mph with a nasty splitter to keep hitters guessing, and that combination will surely still play against major league competition.</p><p>It's now something of a waiting game until Sasaki is the next pitching star to reach that level from Japan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeDcoCMpqObZaKqurC%2B0marnpmdqHqxuMCnpaKml2KzsL6Mo5ipmZ6awKZ50qlkq6ebnnq0rdKaoqJlpKR6o7GMqaasrJWZeqq6jGtna2xdZ4I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
