In one of her most recent social media posts, the country singer gives her followers a glimpse into what she been up to recently – including spending time with her husband in her bathing suit on the lake. "Summer so far," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps and a video. How has the singer gotten into the best shape of her life? Here are all the things she does to stay in shape.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I'm not naturally small," she told Good Housekeeping. "And I'm fine with that, because so many girls come up to me and say, 'Thank you for being normal-sized — it gives us hope that you don't have to be a size 2 to be somebody.'"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_610073705.jpg><p><span>Miranda refuses to go on strict diets. "I did [Nutrisystem] for a month, and then got tired of it. You get tired of any diet. I've tried everything," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health</span></a><span>. She recently changed things up and focuses on eating healthy, balanced meals.. "I just literally would make grilled chicken breast, sweet potato salad. There was no miracle." She also eats veggies, enhanced with flavor. "I like broccoli with cheese, and carrots with ranch dressing," she added. "It's just how I eat." She gets her greens in with green juice. "So if I don't eat anything else green that day, I feel like I've got my green in."</span></p><p><span>Miranda run-walks. "I hate running," Miranda told Women's Health. "Like, in huge red letters: I HATE RUNNING."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/shutterstock_1982615555.jpg><p><span>In a recent l</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>etter to her fans</span></a><span>, Miranda revealed her weight training sessions with her trainer, Bill Crutchfield. "We do cardio, a lot of circuit training. We do things with my body weight, like lunges. A lot of stuff with [resistance] bands," she said. "The stuff nobody loves, but it works!"</span></p><p><span>Miranda's husband is her workout buddy. "He does a pity run with me, and then he does his real run. It's sad. These days, I just try to feel good about myself and know that I'm trying. And if there's wine and cheese, sometimes I have it," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Health</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/shutterstock_1752419006.jpg><p><span>In the same letter to her fans, Miranda shot down claims she had weight loss surgery. "Though I NEVER care what the tabloids have to say about me I wanted to address this certain story they are running this week and set the record straight. I DID NOT have surgery to lose weight. That is ridiculous," she wrote. "I lost my weight the healthy and good old fashioned way. Watching what I eat and working out with my trainer Bill Crutchfield."</span></p><p><span>"It's not about a scale. It's about how you feel and how your jeans fit. And on November 10th when I turned 30, my skinny jeans were finally baggy! Mission accomplished! So for anyone who is tempted to read the 'Trash Talk' please don't," she wrote in her letter. "I am proud to be a normal size girl and I want to encourage everyone to be confident at any size."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbr%2FHmqmeq12oxKq50q6grWWgnby1u4yonWarpaK6pr6MrKZmnpGnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
