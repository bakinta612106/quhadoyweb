Smith recently said that he "firmly" believes Lillard is "miserable" in Milwaukee (3-minute mark).</p><p>"I don't think he's happy at all, and I think when you look at Damian Lillard, that matters," Smith said. "Because you need Damian Lillard, you know, to, be Damian Lillard."</p><p>Lillard is in his first season with the Bucks after 11 years with the Portland Trail Blazers, who granted his trade request out of town and sent him to Milwaukee.</p><p>The 33-year-old earned his eighth All-Star appearance en route to averaging 24.3 points and 7.0 assists per game for the No. 3 seed Milwaukee Bucks, who open their postseason on Sunday against the No. 6 seed Indiana Pacers.</p><p>It's been a tough season for the Bucks, who entered this year with championship expectations but look far from realizing them now. A midseason coaching change from Adrian Griffin to Doc Rivers hasn't helped matters either, with the team going just 17-19 under the latter leader. The Bucks' defense has notably taken a big step back, ending 19th in <a href=# rel=noopener>defensive rating</a> this year after going fourth in 2022-23.</p><p>But Lillard has ultimately fared well this season on an individual basis. There also isn't any concrete evidence that he's unhappy in Milwaukee, especially given his recent comments.</p><p>Lillard also took the time to respond "Captain Planet" to an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram comment</a> from <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bucks Zone IG</a> in which Smith said the Pacers will beat the Bucks in the first round and that Milwaukee should look to trade the star in the offseason.</p><p>He obviously thinks Smith is spewing falsities, but now it's time for Lillard and the Bucks to push the regular season to the past and hope for a better postseason beginning Sunday evening at home versus Indiana.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyEc4OMm6yco6NisaK5yJqlZqSZobmivsNmm56mmZrAbrrBmmSrrZ2kv7R5x56qZq2ena6xvNhmoGakn6uybsDHnmSsoaSqrrW1zqdkoqVdnrs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
