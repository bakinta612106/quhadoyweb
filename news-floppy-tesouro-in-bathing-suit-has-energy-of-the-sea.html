"Rain or shine" she completes two hundred crunches a day at home. "It is important to train for health, beyond aesthetics. Doing physical activity helps circulation, releases endorphins and therefore makes you happy… There is a before and after of fitness," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I always ate what I wanted and I didn't gain weight. That's right: I maintain a healthy diet… No matter how much one trains, if it doesn't accompany food, it won't work," Floppy told InfoBae about the importance of eating right. "I don't eat fried or sweet foods," she continued. Instead, she eats a lot of fruits and vegetables, chicken, fish and lean meats. "I want to stress that I don't starve… I eat, but healthy." On occasion she even cheats, which is usually French fries and ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/shutterstock_1871316343.jpg><p><span>"I don't like to suffer from physical activity.

There is a lot of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>research</span></a><span> backing up the benefits of HIIT workouts, including body fat reduction, improved cardiovascular function, and mental health. It is also time effective.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Floppy also takes two Pilates classes at the Shine Center, "where I focus a lot on stretching and elongation," she told InfoBae. According to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>research,</span></a><span> Pilates exercises are designed to increase muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility, and to improve posture and balance.
