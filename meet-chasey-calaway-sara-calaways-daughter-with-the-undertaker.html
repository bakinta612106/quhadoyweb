She was born on the 21st of November 2002 in Austin, Texas, United States of America. She is an American by nationality and belongs to the Caucasian ethnicity. She grew up with her siblings and parents in Texas where she received her basic education.</p><p>Chasey is believed to still be a student although the name of the school she attends is not known. She does not have any career path yet. However, considering that she was born to highly successful athletic parents, we won’t be surprised to see her opts for a career in sports or make her own career path just like her half-brother, Gunner, did.</p><p>Chasey has not disclosed details of her love life, whether she is in a relationship or not. It is also not confirmed whether she had previously been in any relationship. But, for a young girl of her age, it is believed that Chasey still has some years ahead to build her love life. She has a presence on social media, especially on Instagram, but she does not regularly make posts.</p><h2><strong>How Many Siblings Does Chasey Calaway Have?</strong></h2><p>Chasey Calaway is the first child of her parents, Sara Calaway and Mark William Calaway who is better known by the ring name The Undertaker. She has four siblings; a biological sister named Gracie and three half-siblings, Gunner Vincent, Kaia Faith, and Kolt Calaway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/Chasey-Calaway-and-family.jpg><h3><strong>Chasey Calaway Has Only One Biological Sister, Gracie Calaway</strong></h3><p>Gracie Calaway is Chasey’s only biological sibling and younger sister. She was born on 15th May 2005 in Austin Texas and is now 18 years old. Just like her sister, Gracie prefers to live her life away from the media and so nothing much is known about her life except that she is still a high school student.</p><h3><strong>Kaia Faith Calaway</strong></h3><p>Kaia Faith is Chasey’s half-sibling whom her father, The Undertaker, had with his third wife, Michelle McCool. She was born in August 2012 and she appears to be her father’s favorite daughter. The Undertaker once revealed that Kaia gave him a new perspective on parenthood and made him more involved in his personal life as a father. Kaia also has a biological younger brother, Kolt Calaway, but there is little or no detail about him in the media.</p><h3><strong>Gunner Vincent Calaway</strong></h3><p>Gunner Vincent is Chasey’s half-brother and was born by her father’s first wife, Jodi Lynn. He was born on 3rd August 1993 and is the eldest among all of The Undertaker’s children from&nbsp;his 3 marriages. Gunner is also the only child of his parent’s union. After she divorced The Undertaker, Jodi got full custody of Gunner and this made it difficult for Chasey and Gunner to build a close relationship.</p><p>Gunner’s parents were married for ten years before they got divorced. They got married in 1989 and the union ended in 1999. It is not clear what transpired between them that made the marriage get to the level of divorce. Gunner who was 7 at that time was singlehandedly raised by his mother as she was the one that got full custody of him.</p><p>Gunner Vincent Calaway is today a graphic artist, online gamer, and art illustrator. Rather than following in his father’s footsteps, he made a preferable line of occupation for himself and is successful in it. All his designs have a unique personality and seem to be absolutely amazing.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Chasey Calaway’s Mother?</strong></h2><p>Chasey Calaway’s mother is Sara Calaway. She was born Sara Chirie Frank on 21st July 1977. She is a retired American model, professional wrestler, and wrestling valet. Sara grew a passion for wrestling while she was in high school and was nicknamed The String One by her classmates who were amazed by her strength. She started her professional wrestling career in 2001 with King of the Ring and managed to achieve a certain level of popularity after some time.</p><p>Sara Calaway became more famous after she married The Undertaker who was already an established wrestler even before the time of their marriage. Her fame increased the more after an alleged stalker released several footage of her wrestling online. In the 2001 and 2002 WWE, she appeared as a valet for her ex-husband, The Undertaker.</p><p>Chasey’s father, Mark William Calaway, is an American retired professional wrestler widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Born on 24th March 1965, Mark started wrestling for WCCW in 1987. He was well known for his macabre, zombie image which won him Best Gimmick 5 years in a row.</p><p>The Undertaker retired in November 2020, having wrestled for 33 years, and became one of the most famous figures of the WWF/boundary-pushing E’s generation.</p><h2><strong>Chasey Calaway’s Parents Were Married for 7 Years</strong></h2><p>Unlike his first marriage which lasted for ten years, The Undertaker married Sara for only seven years. Shortly after his divorce from his first wife, Jodi, he exchanged marital vows with Sara Chirie Frank (Calaway) on 21st July 2000. It is not known how they met but the marriage was helpful for Sara’s career as she began to make appearances with him in the wrestling world, thus, making her popularity grow massively.</p><p>During the time they were together, Chasey’s parents seemingly had a loving marriage and made several public appearances together. Moreso, there were many videos showing them wrestling together. However, they would get divorced in 2007 and to date, none of them has stated what went wrong in their marriage. The divorce regardless, Chasey’s parents remain on good terms and jointly raise their two children.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chasey has not always had a close relationship with her father. Neither she nor The Undertaker has ever shared each other’s photos on social media or even spoken publicly about each other. The former WWE champion once revealed that his busy career negatively affected his relationship with his older children and it is still not confirmed if it has in any way improved since he retired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmpp2VqXqktMCsnLJlk5a5osPAsmSsmaKWeqSty5qumrGjYrGiwcahq56qXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZaWjsaa%2B05qinqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
