"However, in this case, multiple factors combine to elevate this play to the level where significant supplemental discipline is required.</p><p>"First, this is not a hockey play. This is an intentional strike with a stick, made with a purpose of exacting retribution on an opponent. This is not a case in which two players are jousting and are mutually aware that sticks are being raised."</p><p>The department of player safety also acknowledged one of Detroit's arguments.</p><p>"While we have heard the argument from the club that this is not a direct blow to the head, we disagree," the video said. "… The brunt of the impact of this blow is clearly absorbed by Zub's head due directly to the actions and choices made by Perron."</p><p>Perron was responding to an injury for teammate Dylan Larkin, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Stockton</a> of the Hockey News noted it was Mathieu Joseph and Parker Kelly instead of Zub who were responsible for that injury.</p><p>Joseph and Kelly were given two-minute penalties, while Perron was given a five-minute major and match penalty.</p><p>Detroit plays six games in the course of a 10-day stretch, which starts with Monday's contest against the Dallas Stars. It then faces the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday, Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday, Anaheim Ducks on Monday and Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday.</p><p>The Red Wings are in fourth place in the Atlantic Division with 32 points through 26 games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGWFcXyMq5ydZaeeu6i%2FjJ2Yr6GUYr2mvtGopWarpai9prrDnptmbl2crq6x0maZsmWenblurcWtnKtlmJ7BbrvNZqqeppGpvLO%2FjJqprZ2dYse2rg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
