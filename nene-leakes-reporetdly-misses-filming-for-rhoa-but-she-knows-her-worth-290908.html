Even though the season 11 was flooded with drama, especially for NeNe, it seems that she still misses the show.
The issue is not that Kenya Moore is back or that she fought with everyone, but it’s all about the money, according to NeNe’s rep.
This is the reason for which she has not started filming with the other RHOA ladies yet."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After all, she’s an OG Housewife and knows her worth and won’t settle for what doesn’t work contractually for her.’</p><p>It seems that the same source continued and said, ‘She loves the show and the platform it creates, so she’s really hopeful that everything will get worked out. To hear otherwise is hurtful. It has nothing to do with anything other than business, and she’s hoping to that the business side gets worked out ASAP and she can begin filming.’</p><p>According to the insider, ‘Both sides want to make this work. Nene does not want to leave the show, but she also knows her worth and value she brings not just to Real Housewives of Atlanta, but the Housewives franchise as a whole.’</p><p>Anyway, NeNe is not getting bored these days, even if she is not filming for the TV show. She has been really busy lately with the opening of the new location of her Swagg Boutique from MGM.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Just the other day, NeNe had a brief photo shoot in her Swagg Boutique and fans were here for it. She’s looking great and calls herself Queen – followers noticed that she also <a href=#>managed to lose a lot of weight</a>.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2K%2FprzOq5ytnJyueq610qycrGWWnrmutc2gZJ%2BnomK%2FqbvAZpmurF2otaZ5yqemsKtdnbKzedaoqa2gXWeGcYWPcWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
