Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!’ the president tweeted, causing many to mock him! Well, back to brainstorming then, Mr. President!</p><p>Here are a few of the dismissing tweets that were making fun of Trump’s idea: ‘’must act quickly!’ fireman donnie is on the way.’ / ‘What would you do with a brain if you had one?’ / ‘did he really say that? I thought he didn’t drink.’ / ‘Flying water tankers? Are you high?’ / ‘Can you just get in a bin or something and go far far away!!!’</p><p>And to add salt to the open wound, some proceeded to compare the Donald’s tweet about the fire with Barack Obama’s words, suggesting that he pays attention to what a ‘real president’ says.</p><p>As you may know, the news that the historical cathedral had gone up in flames became viral very early morning today.</p><p>Firefighters have been doing their best to extinguish the fire but it seems to be a really difficult process due to the size of the building and the gravity of the fire.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It’s believed that the fire started during some renovations.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUpLuiuMNmq6utnaV6rq3DnmSfrZ5ivKd5xaipZqulnLSmv9OipaBlpJ2yunnUrJxmnpyutq%2BzjLCYrZ2iYsGiusqeqaxlpKR6psTToqWgrZmotW66zq2pnmWUlrqmecWiqZ5lYmx%2Bc3%2BWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
