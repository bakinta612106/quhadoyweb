The public are ready for fresh meat and Hardy’s popularity with the girls will surely attract a wider audience.</p><p>According to BoyleSports spokesman Liam Glynn, Hardy is now 4/1 from 6/1 to take over from Daniel Craig.</p><p>There is no doubt that Hardy will be cut out for the job, getting in character seems to be something he takes very seriously. In the 2008 biographical film ‘Bronson’, based on Britain’s most violent inmate Charles Bronson, Hardy gained seven pounds per week through eating and heavy lifting.</p><p>As if this was not mind-blowing enough, he broke two ribs and injured his hand during the training for his part in the film ‘Warrior’.</p><p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ0lHEd9Eyg]</p><p>But do not be phased by all the muscle and meaty attitude, Hardy’s wide spectrum of talent can also take the light-hearted approach, as can be seen in the 2012 movie ‘This Means War’. It is safe to say that if you compared Bronson to Tuck Henson, you would have to take a second look to realise this is the same actor.</p><p>Aside from climbing up the ladder to super stardom, Hardy awaits the birth of his first child with wife and former co-star Charlotte Riley.</p><p>We wish our boy the best of luck with his rapidly expanding future and hope the odds prove true in upcoming Bond films.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktrW%2FjJqjpWWXpHqnu9Fmn5qqlK58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
