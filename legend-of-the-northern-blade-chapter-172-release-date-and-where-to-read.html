Un-kyung questioned their involvement with the remote tribe, considering Mu-won’s comments as empty threats.</p><p>In a fierce battle, their swords clashed as they both tested their limits. After crippling Un-kyung’s arm with a strong stroke, Mu-won delivered a strike that should have ended his life.</p><p>But then something terrifying happened. Undead purgatory’s chaotic power turned Un-kyung into a gigantic monster. His demonic mastery was on full display as his limbs morphed into hideous wormlike appendages. He finally let Mu-won in on the secret that he had been hoarding this power for an important moment.</p><p>After Un-kyung unleashed a barrage of demonic attacks, leaving Mu-won stunned and weak, the battle escalated. Un-kyung mocked him by saying that the brothel owner of Mu-won had killed innocent women and children as part of the Northern Sect’s even worse crimes. The sickening sweetness of his speech mingled with the splatter of blood that covered the battlefield.</p><p>Constricting Mu-Won like a serpent’s coils, Un-kyung encases him in a blood-forged sphere as the chapter comes to a close. Not only does this act represent physical confinement. But it also carries the weight of the Northern Section’s previous transgressions, which Mu-won bears.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-824 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The final words said by Un-kyung, a haunting “sorry,” cast a shadow of uncertainty over the situation, prompting questions over the extent of his corruption and Mu-won’s fate.</p><p>Read More-&nbsp;Revenge of the Iron-Blooded Sword Hound Chapter 55 Release Date and Where To Read</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnJq0prrDZqafZaSdsm66zquroZ2io3qjuMCdnGabmJa9tbHRZmhwal2nsq2xwKycZpyRqbJurc2dZLCglaeybsDOZqmemZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
