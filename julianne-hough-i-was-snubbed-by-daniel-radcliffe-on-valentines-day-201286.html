Like Radcliffe’s character, “I was in Gryffindor,” Hough recalled. “I even stole the scarf just to make sure that I had proof that I was Gryffindor, and then they searched my bag and took it back."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I wrote him a love note,” she confessed. “It was Valentine’s Day and I got him the Valentino Beanie Baby. I never heard back.”</p><p>Hough admitted that she’s now “really embarrassed” about her childhood crush “because sometimes I see him around. I just turn and walk away.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When host <strong>Kelly Ripa</strong>, 41, asked if she’d ever confronted Radcliffe, Hough shook her head. “No! I’m too nervous.”</p><p>Guest host <strong>Neil</strong> <strong>Patrick</strong> <strong>Harris</strong>, 38, assured Hough that everything happens for a reason. “Had he written you back, you could have had a long relationship with Daniel Radcliffe. And now you’re stuck with <strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong>!”</p><p>Hough’s latest film, Rock of Ages, is in theaters June 15; it’s based on the popular Broadway musical. It also stars <strong>Tom Cruise</strong>, <strong>Mary J.
