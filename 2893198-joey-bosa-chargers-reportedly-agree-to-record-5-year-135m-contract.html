They were still good enough to earn him 2016 Defensive Rookie of the Year honors and two Pro Bowl selections, however.</p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Monson</a> of Pro Football Focus ranked him as the 29th-best player in the NFL in 2019 (one spot below his younger brother, <a href=#>San Francisco 49ers</a> edge-rusher Nick Bosa), noting he "notched 71 total pressures and had an overall PFF grade of 89.6, the best mark of his career, while the 49 defensive stops he tallied also set a career high and were eight clear of the figure he recorded in 2017."</span></p><p>Bosa is one of the team's franchise players and a defensive pillar alongside fellow edge-rusher Melvin Ingram III, safety Derwin James and cornerbacks Chris Harris Jr. and Casey Hayward Jr. Now, he'll be paid like it.</p><p>That will increase expectations, though he's met them to this point.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXFxY2aGeXnJqJyyZZKkwKJ5wqGYq5%2BVp8BuvsSppquslZm5unnAoKmenV2pvG6%2BxJymq5xdanq6scCrZGprZaJ6pLvNramam6Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
