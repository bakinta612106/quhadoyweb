And will be a lot more fun. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JuV7puIEsH">https://t.co/JuV7puIEsH&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/zOFpUXSu5E">pic.twitter.com/zOFpUXSu5E&lt;/a></p><p>With more returns comes more opportunities for kickers to tackle, which isn't an ideal situation for those teams that are kicking off.</p><p>Enter Reid, who is accustomed to tackling as a safety and has been used as a kicker in the past when Butker was sidelined.</p><p>Butker is also apparently fine with the plan.</p><p>"We're in a great place with it," Reid said. "Although I know he can make some tackles, I think he's excited to preserve himself, and we can use him where we really need him, which is those fourth-quarter situations to go nail a 60-yard field goal and win the game. It would be devastating to try and trot a guy out there who's still nicked up from trying to make a tackle in the second quarter."</p>NFL <span class=acct>@NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chiefs safety Justin Reid kicks the extra point! ðŸ™Œ&lt;br>&lt;br>ðŸ“º: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CLEvsKC?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CLEvsKC&lt;/a> on NFL Network&lt;br>ðŸ“±: Stream on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlus&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/624TrfDUF6">https://t.co/624TrfDUF6&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/kcIE77E91u">pic.twitter.com/kcIE77E91u&lt;/a></p><p>Reid is 1-for-2 in extra points in his career and has also kicked off seven times. Five of those seven kickoffs resulted in a touchback, underscoring his ability to strike the ball with enough power to avoid problematic field-position situations.</p><p>The 27-year-old even said kicking off like this "might have added some time to my career," so it could be a win-win for everyone involved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqBeoSMnJ%2BinZaoeqvB0q2gp2Wimralec%2BlmKemmaO0bsDOZquao5ViuKqvyqidn6tdpMOmvoybrK2jlad6orLTnqlmppaherPBy55knKCRo7Sm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
