"What happens in Vegas,stays in Vegas ðŸ˜œ," she captioned the post, possibly making a tongue-in-cheek reference to an altercation she had with a fan who threw water at her on stage. Cardi is open about what it takes to achieve her physiqueâ€”here's how she takes care of her health.</span></p><p><span>Cardi is passionate about burning fat, especially visceral fat (the type that is stored deep around the organs and is connected to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>serious health conditions</span></a><span> like heart disease). "A lot of people are so ignorant like why are you working out, you have lipo, but there is this thing called visceral fat," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Visceral fat is that fat that surrounds your organs that you cannot lipo, and that's why sometimes girls with lipo might have a snatched waist with a gut, and that's because they're not working out their visceral fat â€” they just keep eating and eating and their waist is small, but they still got a belly. That's why you gotta work it out."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_2275546659.jpg><p><span>Cardi loves yogurt for a snack, and recommends all women have at least one cup a day. "Plain, nonfat yogurt is best," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Julia Zumpano, RD</span></a><span>. "Both original and Greek-style are excellent sources of protein, calcium and probiotics. For managing your weight, try Greek yogurt. It has more protein, which can help you feel fuller longer."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_67338148.jpg><p><span>Cardi enjoys scrambled eggs and omega-3-packed smoked salmon for breakfastâ€”she usually skips lunch and then has a filling dinner. "Try to eat at least two servings a week of fish, particularly fish that's rich in omega-3 fatty acids," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says the Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "Doing so appears to reduce the risk of heart disease, particularly sudden cardiac death. Many types of seafood contain small amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish contain the most omega-3 fatty acids and seem to be the most beneficial to heart health."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_1503731447.jpg><p><span>Cardi is a proud feminist. "Being a feminist is such a great thing and some people feel like someone like me can't be as great as that," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "But then some people are smart but they don't have no common sense. But being a feminist is real simple; it's that a woman can do things the same as a man. Anything a man can do, I can do. I can finesse, I can hustle. We have the same freedom."</span></p><p><span>Cardi isn't the most confident cook, but is always happy to pitch in on Thanksgiving. "I could help mash up the potatoes, know what I'm sayin'? Y'all want me to peel some vegetables, I'll help you with that!" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I mean if y'all want me to cook a dish, I'll do it. But I don't guarantee it. I think I could do a really good mac and cheese. I don't play with my mac and cheese either, so I feel like if I'm gonna go in and do it, I'm gonna do it good. But I don't think they're gonna trust me enough."&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKSt0Z2gZppdqLWivsSsZKyvmaLAtrXTZq2inJWkeri106FkqJ6WqLK1ecinZK%2Bdl5bAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
