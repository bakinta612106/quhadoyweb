The young actor was born on February 11, 2004, in Venice, California, United States. His birth sign is Aquarius and he belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group. Taj Cross’ birth in the United States confirms him as an American citizen.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/taj-2Cropped.jpg alt="Taj Cross" width=696 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>Taj is one of two children born to formerly married couple Jake Cross and Christena Karras. He has an older sister named Camille Cross who was born on August 4, 1999, which in turn makes her almost 5 years older than the young actor. No child relishes the idea of growing up in a broken home and yet that was what Taj had to deal with as a young child.</p><p>We can’t confirm exactly how old he was at the time, but Taj’s parents went to splitsville when he was still quite young. After the divorce, he and his older sister were primarily under the care of their mother, who is an interior designer. She also owns an interior design studio known as Studio Karras, located in Venice, California.</p><h3><strong>The Young Star Did Not Finish High School</strong></h3><p>Taj spent most of his formative years in Venice and after attending elementary school, he briefly attended an unnamed local high school. He dealt with money problems from a young age and as a result, he had to get a job to augment his family’s earnings. The gainful employment was a relief but it adversely affected his academic process. Consequently, he dropped out to be homeschooled for the rest of his high school education.</p><p>Despite the academic challenges that the young actor had to face, he was still able to receive a high school diploma and graduate in 2019. As things stand though, Taj seems to have held off on furthering his studies at the university level and is, instead, focusing on his career.</p><h2><strong>Taj Cross Began His Acting Career At The Age Of 15</strong></h2><p>We would be hard-pressed to pinpoint when Taj Cross developed an interest in acting, but one thing that cannot be ignored is the fact that he has taken to the profession like a duck to water. Right after high school, a 15-year-old Taj was handed the opportunity to portray Sam, the lead male character in the Hulu comedy series PEN 15.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Taj-Cross-1.jpg alt width=696 height=462 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>The series, which follows the lives of two 7th-grade middle school girls dealing with the awkwardness of being teenagers, was said to have been inspired by the life of Sam Zvibleman, one of the show’s directors. It was a huge responsibility and test for a young actor such as Taj Cross. Add in the fact that the series was his on-screen debut and any seasoned actor would tell you that the stakes were quite high for Taj.</p><p>Alongside other relatively unknown performers such as Maya Erskine, who plays the role of Maya Ishil-Peters, Anna Konkle as Anna Kone, and Taylor Nichols as Curtis Kone, Taj was able to appear in 17 of the show’s 25 episodes across 2 seasons from 2019 to 2021.</p><p>At this point, we have to mention that Taj took some dance classes for his role and it proved to be a masterstroke because anyone who has seen the series will tell you what a good job he did in the dance scenes. Suffice it to say that he Cross passed his first test as an actor with what could be considered to be flying colors.</p><h2><strong>Taj Cross Has Primarily Appeared In TV Series</strong></h2><p>Shortly after his successful outing in PEN 15, producers of Young Rock thought he would be a good fit for some of the show’s episodes. The biopic, which is about former WWE star and Hollywood icon Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, premiered in 2021 and already has 25 episodes.</p><p>Taj Cross plays the role of Gabe in the series and while his 5 episode-appearances do not quite tell the same story of his relevance to the show’s success as they did with PEN 15, the exposure he has gotten from the show, which has already won 2 awards and been nominated for 9 others, has surely done his acting career some great deal of good.</p><p>In 2021, Taj Cross also appeared as himself in the podcast series In Creative Company. The interview series gave viewers a little bit more insight into the life and plans of a young actor who is determined to take Hollywood by storm.</p><h3><strong>The Actor Is Not Very Active On Social Media</strong></h3><p>Most entertainers use the agent of social media to grow their fan base and the results speak for themselves with many well-known entertainers, including Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, accumulating huge followings across various social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and others.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Taj-Cross-2.jpg alt width=696 height=435 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>Taj Cross is slowly getting to grips with how the entire system works but so far though, the actor’s sole social media presence is on Instagram under the handle @taj_cross. He made his first post on the platform on August 15, 2018, and has been able to amass just over 31k followers between then and 2022.</p><p>The content on his page reflects various aspects of his work as an actor while also revealing some fond memories of his childhood with family members.</p><h3><strong>Taj Cross Height Is Just Over 5 Feet</strong></h3><p>Research has shown that the average height of an actor in the United States is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm). At 5 feet 4 inches (163 cm) Taj Cross is at least 5 inches shorter. The actor also weighs 53 kg (117 lbs). Other aspects of his body measurements include 40-28-36 inches (102-71-91 centimeters).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMGitoycqairo2K2tHnAZp2aq6Riv6q%2FyKeeZpmTqbyzecCnm2arn5i2oriMppydoZFitq%2Byy66cp5uVp3quscStZKGhnWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
