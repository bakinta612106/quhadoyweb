This is obviously not how we prefer to do it, but life is not how we prefer it right now. We want to be in the same room, but we cannot risk the health and safety of the Housewives or the incredible crew in Georgia. [RHOA] is regarded by many as the Super Bowl of reunion shows, and it is truly one of my favorite reunions to shoot, I look forward to it, and the fact of the matter is it’s either we do it this way or there’s no Super Bowl this year.’</p><p>He also commented on why it’s so important to move forward.</p><p>‘If we wait for this pandemic to be over for when we all are in the same room, it’s gonna delay everything. We need to move forward, we need to live in reality right now, and the reality is if we’re going to do this, we’re going to do this right now. We’re obviously wrapped on this season, and we want to reset the table so that when we can, we want to start shooting next season.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Andy is <a href=#>recovering from contracting the respiratory illness</a> himself.
