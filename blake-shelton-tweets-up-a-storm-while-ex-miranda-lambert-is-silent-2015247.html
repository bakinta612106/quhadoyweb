 Lambert shockingly replied several minutes later.
@blakeshelton no I can't because it is the best work she has ever done!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Up until Friday, Lambert, 31, had remained silent via social media. Earlier that afternoon, Shelton gave a shout-out to Lambert's best friend<strong> Ashley Monroe</strong>, whose new album, The Blade, was released on Friday via Warner Music Nashville. Lambert also joined Monroe for a surprise performance in Nashville, on Wednesday, July 22, marking her first public appearance following her split from Shelton.</p><p>As was revealed this week, the "Over You" songstress&nbsp;<a href=#>canceled a performance in Canada</a>, which was scheduled on July 8, two days&nbsp;<a href=#>after Shelton filed for divorce</a>. An observer at Monroe's album release party this week told <strong>Us</strong> that Lambert looked beautiful, <a href=#>and was emotional at times</a> as she supported her pal onstage.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Now THIS is what everybody needs to be talking about!!!!!!!!!

In fact, they joked about <a href=#>bizarre new photos of Shelton pushing a stroller</a> on Thursday, to and from The Voice studios.</p><p>"@blakeshelton I knew it…. You WERE pregnant!" Lambert <a href=#>cracked, alongside the pic</a>. "This calls for a drink!"</p><p>Shelton <a href=#>retweeted her message and replied</a>, "Ha!!!!! Busted… I wasn't JUST a fat ass. Drinking shall now begin…"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite both Shelton and Lambert's happy (and supportive) fronts, <a href=#>sources tell <strong>Us</strong> in the Aug. 3 cover story</a>&nbsp;that they are equally "heartbroken" and "devastated."</p><p>In their official split statement shared with <strong>Us </strong>on Monday, July 20, the couple echoed their fragile emotional states. "This is not the future we envisioned," the couple told<strong> Us</strong> at the time. "And it is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately."</p><p><a href=#>As exclusively reported by</a><strong><a href=#> Us</a>,</strong> Lambert got the couple's Nashville property in the split, while Shelton got to keep his Oklahoma ranch. The couple is still "working" it out in terms of <a href=#>divvying up their many pets</a>, a source added to <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmlmZuaerS0xKWrqKZdqcSmsdOsZK6oXZZ6tMDOq6Rmr5ieuaZ5xLFkpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbrXSZqqipJWjwW5%2Bj2psa2xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
