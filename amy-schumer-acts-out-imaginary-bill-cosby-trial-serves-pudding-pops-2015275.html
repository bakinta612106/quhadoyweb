None of us deserve to feel that pang. We deserve to dance like no one’s watching, and watch like no one’s raping.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Talking earlier this year about the sketch, Schumer admitted her Cosby sketch was the most controversial yet, and caused chaos in the inside writers’ room. “I think we probably talked about this scene more than any other scene we’ve done,” she admitted.</p><p>Watch the whole skit in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmqSyZaOYtba5xKtkmpukqHqwwdNmoKaZl567or7YZpmipJxisLC%2FwbJkraqZlrluv8SrrZ6rXWK9trDDoqWgZaCkvbR5kWlobmpnag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
