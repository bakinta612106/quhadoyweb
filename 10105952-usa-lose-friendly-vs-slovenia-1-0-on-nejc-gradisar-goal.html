Berhalter's decision to push full-backs Jones and Shaquell Moore high up the pitch left centre-backs Sean Zawadzki and experienced international Miles Robinson exposed.</p><p>The visitors capitalised in the 26th minute with Gradišar taking advantage of huge space down the left once Bernard Kamungo was knocked off the ball. The in-form Gradišar, who has netted seven goals in 14 games for NK Rogašk in the Slovenian league this season, excellently poked beyond Patrick Schulte for 1-0.</p>B/R Football <span class=acct>@brfootball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Slovenia are beating the USMNT 😬&lt;br>&lt;br>Watch the game on TNT and Max 📺 &lt;a href="https://t.co/TV3gXZB1NC">pic.twitter.com/TV3gXZB1NC&lt;/a></p><p>USA finished the first half with 65 percent possession and only one shot on target in a frustrating 45 minutes.</p>Kyle Bonn <span class=acct>@the_bonnfire</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>U.S. concedes a really ugly goal.

I'm not sure how he plans to do that to a team which has all 11 players in their own half.</p><p>A familiar story played out after the break as Berhalter decided against making changes.</p><p>Despite Diego Luna looking sharp, the Americans continued to lack spark in a second half of little note. The coach decided to make significant changes with 30 minutes to go in search of an equaliser:</p>U.S. Soccer Men's National Team <span class=acct>@USMNT</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>61' - CHANGES: &lt;br>&lt;br>On: Tolkin &lt;br>Off: Moore&lt;br>&lt;br>On: McGlynn&lt;br>Off: Atencio&lt;br>&lt;br>On: McGuire &lt;br>Off: White&lt;br>&lt;br>On: Bajraktarevic&lt;br>Off: Kamungo &lt;a href="https://t.co/r8S9O04I6d">pic.twitter.com/r8S9O04I6d&lt;/a></p>Matthew Bruening <span class=acct>@SportsfanaticMB</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Man I love watching Diego Luna play! So technically gifted! Still a bit raw but could be a future star for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMNT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#USMNT&lt;/a></p><p>Revs star Esmir Bajraktarevic came on for his debut and provided some moments of excitement for the San Antonio crowd at the Toyota Field stadium in Texas. He looked like the only player who might break through the Slovenia defence, playing incisive, fast-paced football from the right wing.</p>Tactical Manager <span class=acct>@ManagerTactical</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Esmir Bajraktarevic has looked great for the USMNT 🇺🇸 and he is just 18. &lt;br>&lt;br>Kid looks technical, with a high soccer IQ, our best player on the field. &lt;br>&lt;br>We need a nickname cause that name is far too complicated.</p>Tom Bogert <span class=acct>@tombogert</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Really wish we got to see the likes of Esmir Bajraktarevic, Jack McGlynn, Duncan McGuire and John Tolkin from the start of the game. Much better since these subs came in.</p><p>Even so, Berhalter left his pursuit of an equaliser too late, with Slovenia comfortably soaking up any sustained pressure USA managed to put together. It's fair to say this is a poor result, but a couple of bright sparks in Luna and Bajraktarevic can be taken forward into what is a huge 2024.</p><p>The biggest worry right now is the style of football Berhalter continues to employ. He looked to exploit space where there was little, and despite dominance of possession, just can't get his men creating consistent chances; a problem that keeps showing itself no matter the squad makeup.</p><p>It's Jamaica next in the CONCACAF Nations League semifinals on March 21, a much more important match where immediate improvement is needed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqGdn6MrqqaZZykwKZ5xaugnqaUocZuwtJmqqWnppq7qq2MamRpZZ%2Bjeq%2BxyZxkoKqRmba0rdFmnqiZnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
