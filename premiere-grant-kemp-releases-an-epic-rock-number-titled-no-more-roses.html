He has teamed up with his friend Mo Brown and launched Terrible Children Records, becoming its first artist.&nbsp;</p><p>The over 2 Million times streamed artist who has the attention of around 400K followers on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, continues proving his prime creative shape in terms of music with a single that will appeal both to connoisseurs of the genre and beyond, to all music lovers out there. His previously released singles, “<a href=#>It’s Always Been You</a>,” “<a href=#>New Addition</a>,” and “<a href=#>Lost Reception</a>,” have amassed over 1.5M streams on Spotify alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Grant Kemp gained a mass following from his days on ABC’s The Bachelor & Bachelorette franchises. In 2016, he won Bachelor In Paradise, and after splitting up with Lace Morris, he appeared on the Australian spinoff in 2018. Although Bachelor Nation will always love him, for Grant, his Bachelor days are over.&nbsp;</p><p>He has been living in LA, working with top producers, and collaborating with artists such as ICY Narco, CØZYBØY, Teqkoi and many others. In mid 2020, he started flying out to Nashville to work with Terrible Children, led by songwriter Mo Brown. Since then, the two have been developing Grants’ projects for almost a year, and “No More Roses” is the first glimpse of what’s to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Kemp clearly has the innate talent to create memorable moments through music, marking our memories forever with a catchy and intimate signature style set to spark mass appreciation and strengthen his presence in the music scene. After listening to the timeless “No More Roses,” we are now excited to follow Grant Kemp into this new chapter of his life, which will probably turn out to be the most successful one of all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Connect with Grant Kemp: </strong><a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> – </strong><a href=#><strong>Spotify</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kvbOxzKKcq51dnL%2BiutNmop6loGK%2FprjEmqqeq12Wu26xz6KaZqqfmLhuutSmmZ6qXam2tbjEnWSnp12ivLOxjKumrJ2jZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
