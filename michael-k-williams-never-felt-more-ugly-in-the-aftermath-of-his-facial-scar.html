I put my hand to my forehead. Then I saw the dark liquid on my fingers. The guy hadn’t been slapping me. He had been cutting me open.”</p><p>Michael wrote: “Strangers would stop me on the street and say they found my scars striking. I began to get gigs in music videos, not even to dance,” including a request from David LaChapelle to photograph him and being cast by <a href=# class=exposure-link data-linktrack=LinkTracker,articleExposure,tupac-shakur>Tupac Shakur</a> from his headshot alone to play his younger brother in his film debut, ‘Bullet’ in 1996.</p><p>The ‘Boardwalk Empire’ star – who is survived by his son Elijah – admitted that the scar made him stand out and appear like a “tough guy,” which he denied actually being in reality.</p><p>Michael added: “I guess the scar gave me an ‘edge’.
