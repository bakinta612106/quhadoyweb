"I often put apple cider vinegar in my hot water. It tastes disgusting. I can't face it every day, so I'll put it in my hot water maybe every other day. It's good for your metabolism," she told <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Cut</a>.</p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1235573945.jpg> <span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p dir=ltr>Elizabeth is a big proponent of eating heavier earlier in the day and lightening up your intake as the day progresses. "I rarely skip breakfast and always eat lunch but the lighter my evening meal the better," she told Healthy Living.</p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1342950061.jpg></p><p dir=ltr>Elizabeth believes in living off the land and avoiding processed foods. "I really try to go out of my way to eat an apple for a snack instead of a cookie," she told Healthy Living. And, "processed and junk foods" are on her do not eat list. "I like simple, natural, easy food. I don't really like food with a lot of chemicals or additives. When I'm at home in the country, I always try and eat food that's grown locally. That goes for meats and vegetables," she added to The Cut. "If I can grow it myself, I'm even happier.</p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1188528492.jpg></p><p dir=ltr>Elizabeth doesn't spend much of her time drinking or smoking. "You can't look good if you're not healthy, and diet plays a big part. You can't smoke and have too much alcohol," she explained to The Cut.</p><p dir=ltr>Elizabeth doesn't believe that you have to spend time in a gym to stay in shape. "I don't exercise, but I am very active," she explained to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Harper's Bazaar</a>. "I believe in gentle exercise and lots of it," she previously told <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Us Weekly</a>. "So I believe in being active, going for walks, stretching, maybe a little yoga or a little Pilates. But I don't like high impact, high energy sports. I don't actually think they do you much good. As long as you get your heart rate to the rate you need it to get, which is a fast walk. But you need to do a bit of it."</p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1173331898.jpg></p><p dir=ltr>Elizabeth counts her steps to ensure she is active enough. "I walk every day, so I try and hit my 10,000 steps a day and I do some stretching every day," she told Us. "And then sometimes I do a bit more, but that's enough for me really."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxknqSZr66jsdOhZKGtoqGyunnIp2SaqaWWeqS0wKKlZqunnrq4scCrZKygn6zAbrvFn2ScraKrsrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
