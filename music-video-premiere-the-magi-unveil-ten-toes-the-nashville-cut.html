We’re also fully aware that life can be painful and difficult, but throughout everything, we found that love conquers all. Standing firm…Ten Toes Down.”</p><p>After being selected as Lightning 100’s Artist of the Week and performing at Nashville’s 4th of July Official Celebration, “Let Freedom Sing Music City,” The Magi recently performed at AmericanaFest in Nashville. On Thursday, September 28, the band will be featured on WSMV-TV’s Today In Nashville</p><p>The Magi came together, as brothers, to collectively write honest and real songs. In 2019, Damien Horne, Kenny Carter, and David “DJ” Lee started The Magi. Since then, they have been building their organic and authentic <a href=#>sound</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In 2020, The Magi released their debut single, “Try,” followed by “Lovely Ways,” “All I Want is You,” “We Three Kings,” “Haters,” and “Ten Toes.” The lyrics of “Ten Toes” piggyback those of “Try.”</p><p>According to DJ Lee, “‘Try’ was a song written from a place of frustration. ‘Ten Toes’ is full of hope and optimism, and the vibe and energy of the song encompasses that.”</p><p>“Ten Toes (The Nashville Cut)” opens on a contagious rhythm, blending tints of funk and country into a deliciously expectant tune. A sawing fiddle rides the fat bassline and crisp percussion as velvety vocals imbue the lyrics with feel-good flavors. Luscious backing harmonies give the song creamy radiance, as well as rich depth.</p><p>“Even in the middle of the darkest night / End of the tunnel I can see the light / Know it’s gonna be alright / Cuz I got faith.”</p><p>Dripping with soulful, positive energy, with “Ten Toes (Nashville Cut), The Magi remind listeners of the power of love and hope.</p><p>Follow The Magi <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>YouTube</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><p><strong>Upcoming Events:</strong></p><p>9/27 – Official Music Video Release: Ten Toes: The Nashville Cut</p><p>9/28 – WSMV TV – Today In Nashville – 2 PM Central</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kura%2FyJxkr6GUmrxuvNGepKKdopp6tbTEZqSan5liwq%2FCxKKjZqyVo3q1u8SsZK2glWK7or%2FHr6ClpJVisLbAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
