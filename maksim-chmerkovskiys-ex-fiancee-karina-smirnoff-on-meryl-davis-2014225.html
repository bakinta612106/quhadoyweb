After watching Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Meryl Davis‘ relationship unfold throughout season 18 of Dancing With the Stars, many fans were convinced that the two are—or should be—more than just tango partners. And that’s what you’re supposed to think, says Chmerkovskiy’s ex-fiancee and fellow DWTS pro Karina Smirnoff.
Speaking about her ex’s chemistry with Olympic ice dancer Davis, 27, both on and off the dance floor, Smirnoff likened it to “when you go to the movies and you see a romantic scene that you believe so much that you kind of believe that they could be a couple in real life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It really is incredible.”</p><p>Smirnoff—who was engaged to Chmerkovskiy, 34, for several months in 2009—echoed that praise after the finale, telling <strong>Us</strong> she was “happy” to see her ex finally take home the Mirrorball. “I was rooting for them,” she said. “It’s been a long season, and Amy [Purdy] and Derek [Hough] did an amazing job, but Derek has five Mirrorball trophies, so it was nice to see Maks walk away with one.” <a href=#>Click here to see the complete list of previous DWTS winners</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppikq5mieqS0zJ6ppKemqLiqxdJmnLFllp6ur6%2FEnmSkmaKeu6J50qagq6afm7Nuu81mpJ6qqaF6pa3VoqpmamBmgXN%2BlA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
