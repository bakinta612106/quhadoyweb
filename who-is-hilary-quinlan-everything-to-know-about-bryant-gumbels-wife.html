His work with outfits like HBO, NBC, and CBS is well documented and his life in general. This article focuses on achieving the same result for the woman he married after his first marriage failed. Let’s get to know all about Hilary Quinlan.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Hilary Quinlan’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Hilary Quinlan</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 1963</li><li><strong>Ethnicity: </strong>Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality: </strong>American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Husband:</strong> Bryant Gumbel</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Children:</strong> 2 – Bradley Christopher Gumbel (step-son) and Jillian Beth Gumbel (step-daughter)</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 6 inches</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Height in Centimeters:</strong> 168 cm</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Weight:</strong> 54 kg (119 lbs)</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Dark Brown</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Blonde</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Western Washington University</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Net Worth:</strong> Est. $3 million</li><li><strong>Famous for: </strong>Being the wife of American sportscaster and journalist, Bryant Gumbel</li><li><strong>Hilary Quinlan’s Instagram:</strong> @hrquinlan</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Hilary Quinlan Now?</strong></h2><p>Hilary Quinlan was born in 1963 in the United States of America, but her exact date of birth has yet to be revealed. The same goes for the exact place of her birth in the United States. The author and celebrity wife enjoy an American citizen’s rights, privileges, and responsibilities.</p><p>Hilary Quinlan has yet to disclose the identity of her birth family members, including her parents and any siblings she might have. She prefers to keep those details about herself private and away from the scrutiny and ears of the public and the media. Hilary belongs to the white Caucasian ethnic group, which is made clear by her physical features, including flowing blonde hair and dark brown eyes.</p><p>Regarding her education, the only information about Hilary Quinlan’s formal education is reportedly the fact that she graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in an unmentioned discipline from Western Washington University. There are no details of her formal education before her years in the University, from her basic school years to high school.</p><h2><strong>Hilary Quinlan Has Been Bryant Gumbel’s Wife For Over 20 Years</strong></h2><p>Hilary Quinlan and her husband, Bryant Gumbel, have been married for over, having been married since December 1, 2002, in the presence of just 25 guests at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/imago0091581389w-1.jpg alt="Hilary Quinlan" width=696 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>She met her husband when she was working with an investment banking firm. Evidently, they were attracted to each other and decided to explore that attraction to its conclusion. They went on a few dates, and by December 2001, Bryant Gumbel asked Hilary to marry him, and she agreed.</p><p>As seen from their wedding date, Hilary and her husband had to wait around a year before marrying each other. However, that relatively long wait from engagement to the wedding has seemingly been worth every second as the couple appear to be happy and content with each other as they approach their 20th-anniversary celebration.</p><p>The guests at the wedding included some close friends and family members, including Bryant’s two children from his first marriage.</p><h2><strong>Does Hilary Quinlan Have Kids?</strong></h2><p>Since Hilary was already almost 40 years old when she started dating and subsequently married Bryant Gumbel, it is easy to understand why she doesn’t have any children with her husband even though they have been married for almost 20 years.</p><p>It is also important to note that Hilary Quinlan’s marriage to Beth Gumbel was her first and that she never had any children from previous unmentioned relationships. On the other hand, her husband was taking his second crack at the institution of marriage and had two children, a son, and a daughter, to show for it.</p><p>As stated earlier, it took Hilary and her husband almost a year to get married after they became engaged. One of the reasons why this happened was down to the fact that Bryant was in a long-drawn-out battle with his then-wife of 28 years, June Baranco.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/imago0099221337w-1.jpg alt="Hilary Quinlan" width=696 height=495 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Hilary’s husband was married to June Baranco from 1973 to 2001, and their marriage produced two children, a son they named Bradley Christopher Gumbel and a daughter named Jillian Beth Gumbel. Hilary’s step-son was born in 1978, while her step-daughter was born in 1984.</p><p>Their parents’ divorce was a bitter and much-publicized one as June accused Bryant of serial cheating and which concluded with Hilary’s husband having to make some concessions that included parting with half of his then $20 million net worth.</p><p>After Hilary’s marriage to her husband, Bryant, she seamlessly slotted into the role of his children’s step-mother and she did an excellent job of it because all evidence points to the fact that Bryant Gumbel’s children adore the woman who invariably took their mother’s place as their father’s wife.</p><h2><strong>Hilary Quinlan Is A Successful Author And Former Model</strong></h2><p>Hilary Quinlan has earned the credit of having written a best-seller that adequately portrays her skills as an author. She co-authored the book titled UNICEF: Top Chefs Unite For UNICEF and proceeded to donate most of the proceedings from the book to UNICEF and other charities, which was an unprecedented move for an author.</p><p>Her professional career also includes working as a professional model as a younger woman, an occupation that more or less put her in the public’s view. She has also worked as a researcher for Goldman Sachs, a globally acknowledged investment bank that provides other similar financial services.</p><p>Amongst other things, Hilary Quinlan currently serves on the board of directors of UNICEF, USA, after joining the organization in 2012. Her duties include consultations and other responsibilities tailored to suit celebrity members of the organization.</p><p>Her efforts as a respected author and a former model have increased her net worth to an estimated $3 million. She has also received public acknowledgment for her contributions to UNICEF after being honored with the Audrey Hepburn International Award for Children.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Bryant Gumbel’s Wife, Hilary Quinlan</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Hilary Quinlan?</strong> Hilary Quinlan is an American philanthropist, former fashion model, and TV producer.
