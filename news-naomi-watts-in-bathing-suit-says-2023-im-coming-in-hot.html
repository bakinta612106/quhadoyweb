She says that she does exercises that focus on toning and flexibility. "I try to work out as often as I can, but I'm not fanatical about fitness. My back carries most of my tension and if I'm stressed, I can't do high-impact exercise, so yoga and Pilates tend to work better for me.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/GettyImages-1434903757.jpg><p><span>Watts opened up about her diet to Harper's Bazaar. She says that she makes sure to eat healthy. One thing she likes to do each day is make green juices. "I'm naturally drawn to greens," she says. "And often whizz up a green juice for breakfast. I'll throw in kale, walnuts, yoghurt and pineapple into my Vitamix."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/GettyImages-1434339592.jpg><p><span>Watts makes sure to eat healthy. However, she doesn't like to fully deprive herself. She tells Harper's Bazaar that she doesn't like to restrict herself when it comes to food. Instead, Watts focuses on balance. "I try to eat healthily but I don't deprive myself," she says. "If I want sweet things I'll have it."</span></p><p><span>Watts has amazing skin, and she makes sure to take care of it. She broke down her typical schedule in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Goop</span></a><span>. She says that she likes to keep her skin natural most of the time. "Depending on what's on the agenda that day, I like to give myself a break from makeup, because I have to use it so much for work," she says. "Letting my skin breathe is so important, and the same goes with hair. Less is more."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>One thing Watts likes to do to improve her wellbeing is meditate. She tells Goop that she tries to meditate each day, and does so when she has free time. "I meditate, if there's time. Creating a clear intention is so much easier after meditating, and it's such a good way to start the day."
