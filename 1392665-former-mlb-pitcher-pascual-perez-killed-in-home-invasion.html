He made the All-Star team in 1983 with the Atlanta Braves, a year in which he won a career-best 15 games. The following season resulted in a 14-8 record, but a subsequent 1-13 campaign forced him out of the big leagues in 1986.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Strauss</a> of USA Today highlights four of the most memorable things about Perez. What made him most widely known on the diamond was "his own version of the Eephus pitch, a slow, extremely high-arching changeup that was renamed 'the Pascual pitch' when he threw it." This often befuddled hitters.</p><p>When holding runners in check on the basepaths, Perez was also known to look between his legs to make sure opponents couldn't get a good jump when he was pitching from the stretch. He would even throw the ball between his legs as a pickoff attempt, per Strauss.</p><p>Stints with the Montreal Expos and New York Yankees rounded out Perez's career, and in Montreal he made his return to the majors in 1987 with a 7-0 record and a stellar 2.30 ERA in 10 starts.</p><p>Perez finished with a 67-68 record in a career ultimately cut short in 1992 for a suspension stemming from cocaine use. He struggled with kidney problems in recent years as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGxxYmuDdnnFqKmmnaJiuq2ujKmgrZuYmr9uvMCsmq6ZnGK9pr7Es2SkoZyhsqV5yKdkoaedmnqqutWaqqKnng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
