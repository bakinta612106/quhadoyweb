The third victim fled in a car with other people but later died on the way to a hospital.</p><p>“At first, there was a fight that broke out between two individuals right next to the bar,” said Heidi Wittwer, who was at the bar at the time of the shooting.</p><p>The sheriff said the person responsible may have been told to leave the bar, and then returned to go on the shooting spree.</p><p>“One person got removed from the establishment and possibly came back a short time later,” said Sheriff Beth.</p><p>Wittwer said the bar was packed with dozens of people when the first round of shots were fired.</p><p>“We were told to duck, and then everyone started running and we all just ran very fast,” Wittwer said.</p><p>Peter Ploskee woke up to the sound of gunshots near his home.</p><p>“Next thing you know, I hear a bunch of shots going off. [I] got up, ran out and looked out the window. Just see people running from the bar in every direction,” he said.</p><p>“I didn’t see nobody. Like I said, when I looked out the window, it was just chaos. People running every direction possible, so you know, who’s who? Is that the guy? Is this the guy? People are just running, people screaming,” Ploskee said.</p><p>Kenosha officials believe the incident was targeted and that the shooter may have known the victims.</p><p>“We don’t believe this was a random act,” Sheriff Beth said. “I currently believe the gunman knew who the victims were.”</p><p>Sheriff Beth is expected to hold a press conference Monday afternoon to provide the latest details in the arrest and investigation.</p><h3>What we know about the victims</h3><p>Officials have not officially identified any of the victims, but one victim’s brother and girlfriend said the Kenosha father had so much more life ahead of him.</p><p>Cartier Gaston drove for hours from Detroit after finding out his youngest brother, Cedrick, was one of the three killed.</p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/10526936_041821-wls-gaston-img.jpg data-imagewarning=Off style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Victims’ loved ones hosted a vigil Sunday night, including Cedrick’s girlfriend Veronica Scalia, as they hold on to one another and the memories of those lost.</p><p>“He would light up your day no matter what.
