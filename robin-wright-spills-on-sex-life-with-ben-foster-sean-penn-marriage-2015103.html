Robin Wright opened up to Vanity Fair in its April 2015 cover story about how her now-kaput marriage to Sean Penn has made her relationship (and sex life!) better with her current fiancé Ben Foster.
“I was pregnant and ostensibly married at 24,” Wright, 48, told the mag. “You hear people say how they have ‘arrived,’ but it was just always there, waiting to come out. For me, it just took a long time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For me, it just took a long time. I’m 48. I’m finally a person. I think I’m finally ready.”</p><p>In 1996, the House of Cards actress wed Penn, and they divorced 14 years later; the A-listers share two grown kids <strong>Dylan</strong>, 23, and<strong> Hopper</strong>, 21. “I [changed my name] really for my children because we’d had kids before we married,” Wright shared, “and I thought that we should all have the same name. That’s traditional.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Robin-Wright-Talks-Sex-Life-With-Ben-Foster-After-Sean-Penn-Divorce-Ive-Never-Been-Happier-3.jpg><p>The mother of two was cautious about discussing her marriage to Penn, who <a href=# rel=noopener>is now engaged to <strong>Charlize Theron</strong></a>. “I’m not in the business of talking about what ‘isn’t,'” she told the mag. “My eyes are set forward and I’ve never been happier. I have too much respect for Sean and our two extraordinary children to sell our past joys and woes for public consumption and fodder.”</p><p>Wright concluded, however, that she and Penn took away several valuable lessons from their union. “I believe we were together not only to have our beautiful children but to learn how to love,” she mused. “For the next time around, the right way. And then, what I’m looking for in people now is kindness.”</p><p>The Forrest Gump actress, who looks ethereal in a cream gown on the cover shot by legendary fashion photographer<strong> Patrick Demarchelier</strong>, found that “right way” with actor <strong>Ben Foster.</strong> The stars first met in 2011 on the set of Rampart, and Wright debuted her engagement ring from her 34-year-old love last January.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the two briefly split later that year, they eventually found their ways back to each other in January 2015. At the time, a source <a href=# rel=noopener>told <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that Foster was “the nicest guy” and that Wright knew she “has a keeper.” Wright echoed similar sentiments to Vanity Fair in her interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Robin-Wright-Talks-Sex-Life-With-Ben-Foster-After-Sean-Penn-Divorce-Ive-Never-Been-Happier.jpg><p>“I’ve never been happier in my life than I am today,” she revealed, spilling some details on her sexy dynamic with Foster. “Perhaps it’s not ladylike [to say], but I’ve never laughed more, read more, or come more than with Ben. He inspires me to be the best of myself. There’s so much to learn. It’s endless. How great! It took me a long time to grow up. Love is possible as life is possible.”</p><p>The April 2015 issue of Vanity Fair hits stands nationally on Mar. 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGarp5Keu27D0aKeoaxdqL2quMusZKimXaiyuXnLop2eZaeewal5wZ6lZp6fqMGmvoysnJqmXaWyr7qMppirqpmWtKZ5kWlobmlgaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
