In a new social media post the model flaunts her incredible figure in a tiny monokini while poolside. "As the cold decides to come.. I keep enjoying the sun," she captioned the post. "Wow," commented one of her followers, while several others added fire emojis. How does she maintain her enviable body? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Claudio can often be found in the water. She shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this video</span></a><span> on Instagram of herself on vacation, taking a dip in an outdoor pool. "Take me back!" she captioned it. Swimming is a good way to get regular aerobic physical activity, according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>CDC</span></a><span>. Just two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity, such as swimming, bicycling, or running, can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses. In addition to the many physical benefits, there are multiple studies supporting the mental health benefits of swimming as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Vanessa strength and weight trains. "The body is the instrument of the soul.. to take care of it because it's the only place to live!" she captioned a photo of herself at the gym. In her </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram stories</span></a><span> she revealed a few of her favorite workouts. She does a lot of weight and strength training to stay in shape. In the videos she is seen using hand weights, a small barbell, and using an arm curl machine.</span></p><p><span>Claudio is also a boxer.

One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span></p><p><span>Vanessa also enjoys surfing. According to the Australian government's </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Better Health</span></a><span>, surfing provides many health benefits including cardiovascular fitness from paddling, shoulder and back strength, which also strengthens from the paddling, and leg and core strength.
