Also struggles to shed and gets stuck on blocks.</p><p>— Tackles high and gives up extra yards after contact.</p><p>— Run-pass transitions against play action are late, and he's susceptible to leaving his man open versus run fakes.</p><p>— An older prospect who will be 24 on draft day.</p><p><b>2023 STATISTICS</b></p><p>— 12 G, 138 TOT, 17.5 TFL, 6 SK, 3 INT, 6 PD, 2 FR, 1 FF</p><p>— Born April 21, 2000</p><p>— 4-star recruit in the 2018 class, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a></p><p>— Injuries: 2018 (knee, missed first season at NC State rehabbing from surgery in high school), 2021 (shoulder, missed all but 2 games, had surgery and missed spring practices), 2022 (upper body, missed 1 game; shoulder, missed 1 game)</p><p>— His brother, Bryse, is a pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers</p><p>If Payton Wilson's draft evaluation was based solely on his 2023 film, he'd have a strong argument to be the top linebacker in this year's draft class. He's an impressive athlete who stands out in coverage and against the run.</p><p>Watson does just about everything right in zone coverage. He uses his hands to help get re-routes, has good eye discipline to locate threats, reads the quarterback's eyes well and has the movement skills to tighten throwing windows. On top of that, he had good ball production in 2023.</p><p>Against the run, the NC State product's biggest asset is his speed, which gives him great sideline-to-sideline range and can help him beat the offensive linemen to the spot when coming downhill. He does need to add some size and strength to be better at holding up at the point of attack and shedding blocks, but that's fixable and far from his biggest issue.</p><p>Wilson's long injury history may give a lot of teams interested in drafting him some pause. That has been the biggest factor that has held him back throughout his career, as a high school injury forced him to redshirt his first year in Raleigh. He'll also be a 24-year-old rookie, so there are a few reasons to worry that he might not have a high ceiling.</p><p>Overall, Wilson could be a good "Will" linebacker in even fronts, but the team that drafts him just has to be comfortable taking a risk.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 6.9 (Potential Role Player/Contributor — 4th Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 90</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: LB4</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Zach Cunningham</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWZ%2BdYOMqZiyrJ%2Bjeri1y6ymp2Wem7lusNGana1lYmV%2FdXnSnKaurJmjtG6%2BxKmmq6xdm7yzec2oqa2gXZius7vLoqWaZaOprrWxjKWZ</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
