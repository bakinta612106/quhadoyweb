This release date was confirmed by a presenter during the Video V Vision Conference in 2023. The Netflix exclusive series entered into development in 2021 and, as such, will be hitting the screens in Q4 of 2024.</strong></p><p>Arcane is an animated series from Riot Games which features characters from their globally acclaimed multiplayer battle game â€“ League of Legends. The series was a massive hit when it was released on Netflix in November 2021, and as such, a season 2 was quickly confirmed. The show makers are, however, holding the details close to their chest, but a few facts have been unearthed.</p><h2><strong>When is Arcane Season 2 Coming Out?</strong></h2><p>Arcane Season 2 will come out in 2024. The makers of the hugely successful Netflix series have confirmed that there will certainly be an Arcane Season 2 and that development has started on it.</p><p>The announcement of season two of Arcane was made following the conclusion of season one on Netflix on the 21st of November, 2021. The CEO of Riot Games, Nicolo Laurent, also took to Twitter that same day to reveal that the development of season two wonâ€™t take as long as season one, i.e., six years but that the series wonâ€™t be coming in 2022.</p><p>Arcane Season 2 release date was confirmed by a presenter during the Video V Vision Conference in 2023 that it will be released in the last quarter of 2024.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ready yourselves, friends. Season 2 of Arcane is now in production.</p><p>Whereâ€™s a Hexgate when you need one? <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3aUeWuQ5Uu</a></p><p>â€” Arcane (@arcaneshow) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">November 21, 2021</a></p><h2><strong>Who Will Be in Arcane Season 2?</strong></h2><p>All the major characters from Arcane Season One, such as Jinx/Powder, Vi, and Caitlyn, will all be making a comeback to Arcane Season 2. The fate of the likes of Jayce, Viktor, and Mel, however, hangs in the balance as they had a rocket fired at them in the ending scene of season one. It is not yet clear who survives and who bites the dust.</p><p>It has also been revealed that three new champions from the League of Legends game will be introduced in Arcane Season 2. Guesses have already been made, and one name that is frequently thrown up is Warwick. Warwick is a monster who hunts the gray alleys of the impoverished city of Zaun. He is the result of some painful experiments.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So yeah, we are working on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#arcane</a> season 2.<br>The good news: you wonâ€™t have to wait for 6 years (the time it took us to making season 1)<br>The bad news: itâ€™s not coming in 2022 ðŸ˜¢ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/IQoPyLnw1J</a></p><p>â€” nicolo (@niiicolo) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">November 21, 2021</a></p><h2><strong>Arcane Season 2 Plot</strong></h2><p>Arcane Season 2 will start off some years from where season one left off, and we are likely to witness the intensification of the rivalry and battle between two siblings, Vi and Jinx/Powder. These two young ladies previously loved each other and fought hard for their impoverished Zaun city.</p><p>However, due to some misunderstanding, Powder thinks that Vi abandoned her. She is taken to the richer city of Piltover and thus forms a formidable enemy for Zaun and Vi. In the final episode of season one, Powder and Vi go head to head after Powder kidnaps Vi.</p><p>They both survive the encounter, but Powder fires a rocket at a meeting where Piltover votes to give Zaun independence. This is likely to worsen the battle between her and her sister. It may also <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">lead</a> to a full-blown battle between the two cities in Arcane Season 2.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Two cities and two sistersâ€”forever changed.
