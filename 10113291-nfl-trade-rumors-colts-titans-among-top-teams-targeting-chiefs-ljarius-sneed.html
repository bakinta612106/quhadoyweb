He is currently set to stay in Kansas City on the franchise tag.</p><p>Sneed has 303 career tackles with 40 pass deflections and 10 interception. He registered 78 tackles, 14 pass deflections and two interceptions across 16 games for the Chiefs in the 2023 season.</p><p>He helped the franchise win the Super Bowl for the second consecutive season. He is also just one of two players, alongside New England Patriots safety Kyle Dugger, to record at least two interceptions and five tackles for loss in each of the past three seasons, per <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS Sports</a>.</p><p>The Titans and Colts could both use a defensive upgrade, as each team finished towards the middle of the league in passing yards <a href=# rel=noopener>allowed</a> in 2023. This, combined with talented quarterbacks like Trevor Lawrence and C.J. Stroud playing in the division, means that grabbing a player like Sneed could be worthwhile.</p><p>Still, it will be costly, as his price being an issue shows that he intends to get quite a pay raise. The Titans have more room to work with in that regard, as it has $54.2 million available, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Over The Cap</a>. Still, the Colts have $22.6 million available, so it could also afford to pay Sneed.</p><p>Whether the franchises are willing to do that will be the deciding factor, and if not, Sneed will return to a Chiefs team looking to be the <a href=# rel=noopener>first</a> to three-peat since the 1965-67 Green Bay Packers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWh%2Fen2Mp52lZaSnrqWxjKuspqeiqHqku8utqmasmamur7%2BMmqSoppdiwbC8jK2cmqWjYsGivsaeq6Kml2KwqbXEn6pmpJqWv6rB0maqp52VmQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
