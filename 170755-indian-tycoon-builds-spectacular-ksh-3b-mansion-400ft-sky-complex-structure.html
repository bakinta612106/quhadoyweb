It’s a complex structure, and the finishing work is going on. We will finish the project as per contract and hand it over."<p class=align-left>Some of the impressive features of the house include a wine cellar, an indoor heated pool, an outdoor infinity pool and a rooftop helipad, among other amenities, but the finished product has remained shrouded in mystery since it was announced in 2010.</p><p class=align-left>Beneath the grand mansion is a 34-storey skyscraper house with around 81 apartments across three blocks.</p><h2>Who are Vijay’s neighbours?</h2><p class=align-left>The tycoon’s master house also borders Vidhan Souda to the left, Cubbon Park and Chinnaswamy <a href=#>Cricket</a> Stadium in the front, Football/Kanteerava Stadium at the back and Whole MG Road View to the Right.</p><p class=align-left>Although the mansion is near completion, Vijay may not set foot in it; he left India in March 2016 after lenders and investigating agencies came after him for allegedly borrowing vast sums of money and never returning any of it.</p><h2>Vijay fined R524</h2><p class=align-left>The 67-year-old has been fighting against the charges ever since, and India has attempted to extradite him from the UK, where he sought refuge.
