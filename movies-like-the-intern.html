When people start coming in, their entire lives become a roller coaster. “Why do we always have to tell our experiences through relationships, why can’t we start with I am single?” argues the film. It’s a must-see if you want to laugh out loud and simply enjoy and chill with your buddies, especially if you’re a girl.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u94f442099f09db8669b257e588b30824><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Movies Like Fried Green Tomatoes: A Cinematic Feast of Similar Stories</span></a><h2>ALSO READ : <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">37 Psychological Thrillers On Netflix That Will Leave You Surprised</a></h2><h3><span id=Its_Kind_of_a_Funny_Story>It’s Kind of a Funny Story</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/It’s-Kind-of-a-Funny-Story.jpg alt width=825 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The film, which is based on Ned Vizzini’s novel of the same name, examines the serious and critical issue of suicide and psychiatric difficulties in a lighthearted and humorous manner.
