Over a year after calling it quits, <a href=#><strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a> is shedding new light on why the Jonas Brothers decided to throw in the towel.</p><p>"We were really lucky. Being a band that was able to tour, travel the world, and make music that we love, and then be received well I think was great," Jonas, 27, said during an interview with <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a> on Wednesday, Jan. 7. "At the end the friction was too much. We just really needed to break away and kind of do our own things for some time."</p><p>Kevin and brothers <a href=#><strong>Joe</strong></a>, 25, and <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a>, 22, announced in October 2013 that they were disbanding. One month earlier, they showed signs of trouble when they cancelled their 19-date tour just two days before the first show.</p><p>The New Jersey natives have moved on <a href=#>from the "rift"</a> they once had, and still remain close. As it turns out, its the breakup that helped them keep their relationships intact as they embark on solo projects.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I think that's why we're still close now," Jonas told HuffPost Live. "It's because we aren't in the band. I think that constant of butting heads and working together — we chose to be a family and not a band."</p><p>Jonas has also started a family of his own <a href=#>since the decision.</a> He and his wife <strong>Danielle</strong> welcomed daughter <strong>Alena</strong> in February 2014. He's recently had a cameo on The Real Housewives of New Jersey (<a href=#><strong>Kathy Wakile's</strong> contractor!</a>), and was eliminated from The&nbsp;Celebrity Apprentice this week. Nick, for his part, now has a solo career with hits like "Jealous" and "Numb" and has since turned heads with his <a href=#>hot, buff body.</a> Joe has kept a low profile, but reunited with ex Demi Lovato on stage back in September.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKerpmjequ7zZqqZp2opbmitc2sZKOnnpbAbq7RqKuhnaKoerS8y6KrZqyYmnqnvsicq6KnnmLEor%2BMraaoZZ2qsKl5kWlobnBh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
