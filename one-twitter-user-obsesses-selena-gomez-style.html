This year, Gomez appears to be rejuvenated and ready to dedicate all of her energy to her fans. &nbsp;In November she released a compilation album that includes solo work and songs from her band, Selena Gomez & The Scene. &nbsp;However, while Gomez seems to be primarily focused on her music career, one of her most dedicated fans seems to be more fixated on something else. &nbsp;One Twitter user has repeatedly and shamelessly expressed his love for Selena Gomez’ impeccable style and hopes to one day get some personal pointers from the star. Here are five tweets from a young man who is obsessed with Selena Gomez’ style.</p><h2>5.</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>i like your style it makes me wild<a href=#>@Selenagomez</a></p><p>— Jotellersd (@JotellerSd) <a href=#>July 1, 2014</a></p><p>The simplest compliments are usually the most heartfelt, and this Twitter user conveys his message to Selena Gomez in just one sentence.</p><h2>4.</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>i really love her style<br>i think she could give me styling tips because she s my styling angel my styling queen <a href=#>@Selenagomez</a> ~ Jotellersd</p><p>— Jotellersd (@JotellerSd) <a href=#>February 1, 2014</a></p><p>Not only is Selena Gomez an angel, but this Twitter user believes that she is a queen as well. &nbsp;Perhaps one day she will actually be able to grant @JotellerSd’s wish and share some of her styling tips with him</p><h2>3.</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@selenagomez</a><br>I like your style you makes me wild<br>You looks so great Everytime I see your face you put me in a state a state of shock girl</p><p>— Jotellersd (@JotellerSd) <a href=#>November 22, 2014</a></p><p>@JotellerSd has added to his original “I like your style it makes me wild tweet,” with a few more song-like lines.
