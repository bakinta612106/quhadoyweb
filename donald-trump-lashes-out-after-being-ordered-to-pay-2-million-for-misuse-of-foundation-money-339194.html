The remarkable fine in the size of $2 million was ruled by New York state judge Saliann Scarpulla on Thursday, marking the end of the ongoing lawsuit against the President. Trump abused the functions of his charity by using it to advance his political career.

He tweeted: “I am the only person I know, perhaps the only person in history, who can give major money to charity ($19M), charge no expense, and be attacked by the political hacks in New York State. No wonder why we are all leaving!”</p><p>He defended himself by saying: “Every penny of the $19 million raised by the Trump Foundation went to hundreds of great charitable causes with almost no expenses. The New York Attorney General is deliberately mischaracterizing this settlement for political purposes.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It will be interesting to see if the latest surprising revelations will have impact in 2020 when Trump tries to get a second term against a motivated Democratic opposition.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUpLuiuMNmq6utnaV6ra3SoZysZZ%2BqwW6txa2cq2WSmravs4yoqZ2dopqxbsDOZqeasV1neq61y6WgqKZdm7yzecyiqq6rlWK8p3nFqKynnJGptrC6jKamp52pYoB0hZBya2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
