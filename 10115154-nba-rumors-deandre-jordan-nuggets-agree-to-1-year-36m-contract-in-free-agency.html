Former Clippers coach Doc Rivers recently said Jordan should have his jersey retired by the franchise.</p><p>"He was the original one. He's All-Defense, Olympic gold medalist, NBA champion," said Rivers. "He stayed there the longest, was traded, never just left."</p><p>While Rivers' quote wasn't accurate—Jordan did choose to leave in free agency in 2018—it goes to show what an impressive career he had with the Clippers. As Jordan plays out the final stretch of his career in Denver, you can still see occasional flashes of what made him so dominant in his 20s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2BdoCMp5maZaKqurC%2B0mabnpmemb%2BmecmoqZ2ZnmK7trPGnqusZZGcv6axjK2mZmldrrKivoxsbaZlk6S7tb7AnKtmoZ5is7OxxGaYoJ2emMaAvsSfdK6oo6m%2Foq%2FTZ5qopQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
