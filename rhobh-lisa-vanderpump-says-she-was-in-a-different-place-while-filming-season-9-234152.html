I won’t watch it because it was a very hard time in life this season,” Vanderpump shared.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lisa Vanderpump Opens Up About Taking ‘Antidepressants’ <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/XTuSLtpX0D</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RHOBH</a></p><p>— All About The Tea ☕ (@AllAboutDaTea) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 11, 2019</a></p><p>Most of Vanderpump’s issues this season stem from the tragic passing of her brother, Mark Vanderpump. According to <i>All About The Real Housewives</i>, Vanderpump opened up about losing her sibling and admitted that she struggled hard after his death.</p><p>The <i>Vanderpump Rules</i> star confessed that, for the first time in her adult life, she was prescribed antidepressants and underwent counseling to help deal with her grief. But even with the meds, Vanderpump was extra emotional, and starring on the reality show didn’t help the situation.</p><p>While Vanderpump revealed that she shared a few laughs with her co-stars early on, she admitted that she was “in a different place” this season. As fans will recall, Vanderpump reportedly refused to film with her co-stars at one point, which stirred up a lot of drama outside the show.</p><p>This includes Vanderpump’s rumored feud with Lisa Rinna, with whom she suffered a major falling out this season.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsHk-nClwaK/</p><p>Given everything Vanderpump went through last year, it is understandable that she had a difficult time in front of the cameras. We also get why she could not watch the Season 9 trailer, which probably would have opened up old wounds.</p><p>Hopefully things are going better for Lisa Vanderpump and she makes amends with all of her co-stars.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The new season of the <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> premieres Feb. 12 on Bravo.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyjtIyloKyZXauur7DEq6eupaBiwKLF0maqoZ1drK60ecinZJpllJ6zp7HRnqWtZaChrqSxjLCfoqSVYrOquMyipaBlo5qutLvNZnBmamNpfnZ%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
