The northwest portion of the map is covered in snow, and since pine trees can thrive in this extreme weather, you should find Timber Pines strewn all over that location. However, not every tree in the area is a Timber Pine. Some trees are taller and thicker with reddish-orange bark and light-green foliage. Those are the Timber Pines you’re looking for, but remember that the challenge asks you to chop them down with Ripsaw Launcher. You could destroy the trees with a normal harvesting tool, but toppling pines with a pickaxe doesn’t count towards the challenge. Luckily, the requisite item isn’t far away.</p><h2>Fortnite: <strong>Where is the Ripsaw Launcher?</strong></h2><p>Most items and weapons in <strong>Fortnite</strong> spawn in semi-random locations, but the Ripsaw Launcher is not one of them. These serrated-blade bazookas are designed to chop down trees, not cut through cars (although you can do both, in case you’re wondering). Now, if I were a weaponized lumberjack tool, where would I hide? In a lumberjack’s building, of course.</p><p>Northeast of Logjam Lotus, you can find a woodsy office building with the Logjam logo. This is The Chop Shop, and if you head in the main entrance, hang a right, and keep going straight through a door, you will enter a loading bay. Turn around immediately, and you should see four Ripsaw Launchers hanging on the wall. Alternatively, you can directly enter the loading bay by venturing into the gray, concrete section of The Chop Chop. Either path should lead you to a Ripsaw Launcher, so just pick one up and let ‘er rip.</p><p>Now, some advice on proper Ripsaw Launcher usage. The weapon holds 12 saws, three saws to a clip. Each saw slowly travels in an arc and has to spin up before launching. Also, the tree will fall in the direction it was hit and damage anyone in its way, including allies and enemies. Gravity doesn’t discriminate.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Ripsaw Launcher in hand, just shoot down five Timber Pines, and voila, you’ve completed the challenge. Simple as that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOn6arrJ6ewaZ5x6iuZqyfYrOqusNmmKecXaC7sK%2FKZpuor55iwaq5wZ6pZqiZo7K0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
