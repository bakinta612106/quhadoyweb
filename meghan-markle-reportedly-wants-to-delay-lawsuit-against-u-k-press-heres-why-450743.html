Apparently, her legal team is heading to a U.K. court tomorrow to request that the judge makes a summary judgment as opposed to actually going to trial."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As you might know, the beginning of her privacy trial against the Mail on Sunday is supposed to happen in January but the former Royal is asking for a delay and here’s why!</p><p>Apparently, her legal team is heading to a U.K. court tomorrow to request that the judge makes a summary judgment as opposed to actually going to trial.</p><p>In reality, this is only possible when one has total confidence in the case at hand.</p><p>Furthermore, if Meghan Markle’s legal representatives are unable to get the summary judgment, they will be requesting a delay of the trial that is supposed to start on January 11.</p><p>This comes after the Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand biography, Finding Freedom was included in the case, which means that Meghan’s attorneys need more time to prepare and respond accordingly in court.</p><p>The publication involved in the lawsuit has already asked to amend their defense back in September, claiming that Meghan or her pals have actually collaborated with the biography’s authors to portray her in a more positive light.</p><p>Even though the former actress’ team argued against this accusation, the judge agreed with the media company.</p><p>One rep for Meghan and Prince Harry shared via E! News about this that: ‘The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. This book’s based on the authors’ own experiences as members of royal press corps and their own independent reporting.’</p><p>It’s been about a year since Meghan sued the U.K. publication for its apparent ‘intrusive and unlawful publication of a private letter written by the Duchess of Sussex.’</p><p>Back then, Harry shared a statement in which he emotionally compared his wife’s situation with the press to his mom, Princess Diana’s own troubles with the intrusive media that tragically led to her untimely death.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences—a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son. I’ve seen what happens when somebody I love is commoditized to the point they’re no longer treated or even seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,’ Harry stated at the time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrSprc1mpJqqm6Gybr7EqaarrJWZubp51pqlratdqbxusMSlmLJlnJbEtMHIrWSan5Geu7TAjK5kpGWgp7K0v4yhnKudo2LEqcWMbWxpb2RofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
