However, she doesn't want to brag about herself too much. She talked about this to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Just Women's Sports</span></a><span>. "I'm not always the one that is going to be super loud and yelling about what I've done. I let my work speak for itself, but it was really nice to have one of my teammates say what I don't always say."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Gray shared some of her wellness secrets in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Sports Business Journal</span></a><span>. She says that she has started tracking her sleep, and seeing what helps her get more hours in. "Sleep is a big thing for me after games—I don't sleep that well, especially if it's a loss. So, I started using it to recover muscles. I would use different sets. I started researching cellular health and the advantages of using Haelo. I would use it after a practice or before practice when I needed the extra boost of energy. Then on the mental side of it, I would run different sets to be able to help me sleep or relax. So, it was both sides of using Haelo, both the mental and the physical side, that really helped throughout the bubble."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/shutterstock_1221112825.jpg><p><span>Gray shared with Sports Business Journal that she has had to make some changes in her diet. "Back in college, I injured myself a lot," she explained. "My college career was cut short because of injuries. So, the last three to four seasons, I've really tried to figure out what to put in my body. I've cut out certain things. Food-wise, I've cut out pork. I don't consume as much red meat anymore."</span></p><p><span>Gray shared her secrets for recovering from exercise and preventing injuries with Sports Business Journal. "Things like Normatec. Game Ready, obviously, that's been around for a long time. Compex, I'm able to transport the stim unit without having it in a wall, so it's like a smaller stim unit. I've used the Hypervolt and the Theragun. I actually used something this summer—it goes from hot to cold, it's called the Kelby. It doesn't get as cold as the Game Ready, and it's not as hot as a heating pad, but still having the contrast is good. It didn't work for me as much, but I've tried that. I probably would have to try that a little bit more."</span></p><p><span>During the pandemic, Gray and her wife started cooking a lot more. "We found we were able to cook different meals," she told Sports Business Journal. "We made zucchini lasagna. That was amazing. We've made it like once or twice since, but we'll probably go back to that this summer. And I enjoy cooking. I love being in the kitchen and just enjoying and bringing things to life. So, I just found different things to do. It was a fun experience to be able to just be at home because I'm never really in one place for longer than 10 to 14 days."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKS0xKWqnpldnL%2BixYyipWasp6R6sbXEnJxmr5%2BnuLDB02aenpmiYra0ecCcq6KukamypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
