These two words seem very inadequate. But that is my heart....I chose to engage in an improper relationship. I also made several poor decisions following the end of that relationship and in the aftermath of the accident. I accept full responsibility for what has happened.</p><p>What of that relationship? The same ESPN report issues that Dorrell, a former Arkansas volleyball player who was hired to&nbsp;work for the Razorbacks Foundation, was said to "at one time" be engaged to Josh Morgan,&nbsp;the athletic department's director of swimming and diving operations.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Photo Credit: IBTimes" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/393/438/260401-jessica-dorrell_original_crop_340x234.jpg?1334174435 image=https://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/393/438/260401-jessica-dorrell_original_crop_340x234.jpg?1334174435 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>Photo Credit: IBTimes</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit></span><p>ESPN received the news from a source close to the situation, and it was believed that Morgan was still employed at the time of the report.&nbsp;</p><p>That seems to have changed.&nbsp;</p><p>We do not, as of yet, know when the two were engaged, or when that ceased being the case. What we do know is that Morgan is no longer listed on the campus' website.&nbsp;</p><p>Petrino is not the only man to have lost his job in the awful story, because Morgan may very well have moved on.&nbsp;</p><p>The swimming news site, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swim Swam</a> reports on Morgan and his position with the university. They issue that he is no longer listed on the colleges site, and is no longer listed as his most recent position as strength and conditioning coach.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bleacherreport.com/images/pixel.gif alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The unfortunate affair&nbsp;appears to have&nbsp;cost him his job (whether it be from intimidation, firing, or resignation is unclear). He previously held a position as the team’s Operations Manager.</p><p>A selfish decision by Petrino and Dorrell have cost them both their reputations and standing in the community, a potential career for Morgan and has caused a black eye for the program.</p><p>What's more, Petrino is married with four kids.</p><p>The scandal is not only ugly, but far reaching.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGpsYWx%2BcnnJnqqsoZOWeqW70aucpaRdlrOnrcirZLChpJ16o7vBm7BmqJWpv6q6zmakqK2eqcBuwNGepJ6mlKTCtHnCqKOlmaSav6K4jJ2YppmXmg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
