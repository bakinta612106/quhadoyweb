The net worth is an astounding number for the 22-year old sensation who is most well-known for her role as Sam Puckett on the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly and its spin-off series Sam & Cat. Outside of her major role on Nickelodeon, McCurdy has appeared on several other television shows including Malcolm in the Middle, Lincoln Heights and Zoey 101. McCurdy is also a blossoming musical talent and has released on album with Capital Records Nashville. The album was successful for a first-release and McCurdy continues to work on her music as she acts in both film and television. There’s no doubting her popularity. She’s won dozens of awards from Teen Choice to Young Artist, and she seems to just be starting. A frightening thought considering her net worth is already pushing $200 million.</p><p>Those are the basics about Jennette McCurdy that you probably already know, here’s what you may not know about the young star…</p><p><strong>Playing with the Boys</strong></p><p>As you may or may not know Jennette is one of four and she’s the youngest. The other three, her older brothers, didn’t take it easy on her. McCurdy grew up playing football with her brothers and she took up martial arts as a kid. In fact, she was a Tae Kwon Do master.. at least she use to be. So watch out!</p><p><strong>Olympic Hopeful</strong></p><p>While Jennette was getting beat up by her older brothers she was also honing her skills as a figure skater. In fact, if her acting and music career fell through you may have seen her in the Winter Olympics at some point. She was a talented enough figure skater to be nearly a pro. Unfortunately, she couldn’t pursue both careers and skating got dropped.</p><p><strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></p><p>A little known fact about Jennette is that she composed an article entitled “Off-Camera, My Mom’s Fight with Cancer” that was published in the Wall Street Journal on June 11, 2011. The articles details her mother’s struggles and her family life as the dealt with the crisis. Debra McCurdy died on September 20, 2014 after battling cancer for 17 years.</p><p><strong>Hoop Dreams</strong></p><p>Jennette McCurdy isn’t in the limelight for her dating exploits like several other young stars, but that doesn’t mean she’s sitting home eating ice cream on Saturday nights. She did date NBA young star Andre Drummond for a brief time in 2013. The relationship didn’t take off though…</p><p><strong>Philanthropist</strong></p><p>Whether you’re aware of this or not, it should be known that Jennette dedicates a fair amount of her time to charity. She actively supports the Cody Waters Foundation (for a young friend who died of brain cancer), Invisible Children Inc. (for child soldiers), and the St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. She’s even done PSA’s for Safe Kids USA which appeared on Nickolodeon and TeenNick. It’s great to see a young star so involved with helping others.</p><p>Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYsGptc2gqmacmZm7tXnKp6awZZqau6%2Bx062cZqWTmMKzsNho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
