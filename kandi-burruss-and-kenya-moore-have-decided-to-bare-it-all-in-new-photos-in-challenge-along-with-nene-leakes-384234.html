I love you for this. Even though some people take this as a slight or a personal dig, this really is about the beauty within you. I knew if I could get some of the world‚Äôs most beautiful and favorite people to take off their make up and show how regular and still beautifully flawed they are, it would help other women with their confidence.

You are beautiful both inside and out. And I have absolutely no issue with makeup or additives at all.
