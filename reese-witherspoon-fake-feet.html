Those fake feet are are modeled on MY FEET!” &nbsp;Unfortunately; however, Wild will not be released in the United States until December 2014, leaving&nbsp;the appearance of Witherspoon’s fake feet will remain a mystery until then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGipnp2jmnq4tdOhnKuroKS8r3nFmqKeZZaasrV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
