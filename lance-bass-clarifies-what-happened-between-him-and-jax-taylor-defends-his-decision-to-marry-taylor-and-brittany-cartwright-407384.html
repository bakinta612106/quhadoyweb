Viewers will remember he stepped up to marry the couple after their pastor was exposed for being homophobic.</p><p>Fans wanted to know why he’d do such a thing with Jax’s history of being the villain and defending his pastor.</p><p>Bass opened up about all the drama on his podcast.</p><p>‘You wanna know what really went down? Look, I’m gonna preface this right now, because I know we have a lot of new listeners here. I do not think Jax Taylor is a racist or a homophobe, and I’ve said that millions of times. I would not be acquaintances with someone if I thought you were a racist and a homophobe. It just doesn’t make sense. The whole reason I married him and his wife last summer was I thought it was a great statement, because I was replacing their [homophobic] preacher. To me, that was a statement, and I thought it was big of them to make that statement.’</p><p>He went on to say that they went into business together because he wanted to show the world that Jax had changed; however, he saw that that wasn’t the situation when he watched the 40-year-old tweet up a storm during the episodes airing.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBCEbFZFqEd/</a></p><p>vand</p><p>He went on to explain: ‘I was happy to back him and believe in him, and I always want the best things for him — but then, this season started airing, and he reverted back to the same crap he was spewing. I obviously have not heard anything racist come out of his mouth. I mean, I hear of tweets. I’m still confused exactly, the exact tweets everyone’s pissed about. This is all I know: I never heard him say a racist thing, except the big nose thing recently.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Jax has yet to respond to Bass’ rebuttal.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclruksYybmKyrXZi5or7In6Ceq12staLAjKGYqaiVo7KlecGeq7CdlaN6qbXMZpinnF2frrl505qwpaeiYrGmssSnm6xlmJ7AbrDEnKCsoZ%2BjerW7jKaYq6qpYsGixcuoqWaZnpl6o77IrauapqlisKK%2B07Cpop%2BYqXp1fJZsb21n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
