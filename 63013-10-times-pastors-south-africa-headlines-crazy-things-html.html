Christianity in Mzansi has been a question of debate for some time now. Most of the religious leaders have been involved in things that leave the world with unanswered questions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Most of the religious leaders have been involved in things that leave the world with unanswered questions. What is more disturbing is the fact that their followers are willing to do whatever their pastors tell them without question. Take a look at some of the acts.</p><h2>The infamous acts of Pastor Penuel Mnguni</h2><p class=align-left>Do you remember what Pastor Penuel of End Time Disciple Ministries did to his congregation? He has done a lot of crazy acts that make the world wonder if his followers are sane. The following are the three insane things done by the young pastor in the name of God.</p><h3>1. Swallowing live snakes</h3><p class=align-left>Live snakes are poisonous, but Pastor Penuel does not think so. He convinced his followers to <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">eat the crawling creatures</a>. He claimed that no harm could come to those who ate it because he had earlier commanded a live snake to turn into chocolate, and it was so. According to reports, he also made his congregation to eat dog meat and worms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3fd5b05cd06c6582.jpg><h3>2. Making women strip naked in church</h3><p class=align-left>Pastor Penuel asked his female followers to remove their clothes so that he could pray for them. As if this is not enough, he was seen walking and sitting over their bodies as a way of delivering them from evil spirits.</p><h3>3. Ordering congregation to eat a carpet</h3><p class=align-left>The self-proclaimed young prophet asked his followers to eat the church’s carpet, saying the power of God had turned it into food. He started eating it himself and urged the congregation to do the same. The End Time Disciple’s Ministries posted the video on its Facebook page claiming that those who were sick had been healed and that many received breakthroughs.</p><h2>Insane acts done by powerful pastors in South Africa</h2><p class=align-left>South Africa has a long list of men of God that are known globally for their great contribution to Christianity. Some of them have, however, come under intense scrutiny after what they made their followers do or believe.</p><h3>4. Lethebo Rabalago and doom insecticide</h3><p class=align-left>Pastor Lethebo of Mount Zion General Assembly sprayed <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">doom insecticide</a> on the faces and other parts of his followers, claiming it had the power to heal terminal ailments like HIV-AIDS and cancer. After being accused of endangering the lives of people, he claimed that he was only using unconventional methods of healing. Tiger Brands came out to refute the claims saying that their products are meant to kill specific insects and are harmful to humans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9ff21bfdda1e3809.jpg><h3>5. Prophet Light Monyeki and rat poison</h3><p class=align-left>Prophet Light Monyeki of Grace Living Hope Ministries made his followers drink holy water that had been <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">mixed with rattex</a>, which is used to kill rats. The church’s believers ran to the front to drink the poison after the prophet drank some and said it was a demonstration of their faith.</p><h3>6. Alfred Ndlovu and 30 days dry fasting</h3><p class=align-left>Pastor Alfred wanted to emulate Jesus Christ, who had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights according to Biblical recordings. The pastor went to the nearby bush where there are no material temptations so that he could <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">fast for 30 days</a> and nights without eating or drinking as Christ did. A hunter later discovered his dead body. Malnutrition could not respect his faith.</p><h3>7. Pastor Lesego Daniel and grass eating</h3><p class=align-left>Pastor Lesego of Rabboni Center Ministries told his followers to <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">eat grass</a> like cows to draw them closer to God. The members of the church later claimed that the act had delivered them as some had been healed. Some followers, however, became ill.</p><h3>8. Prophet Bongani Maseko and engine oil drink</h3><p class=align-left>The head of Breath of Christ Ministries shocked the world when he made his followers drink <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">Havoline engine oil</a>. He claimed that the poison in the drink could not harm the people because prayer renders the poison harmless.</p><h3>9. Pastor Alph Lukau and the resurrection power</h3><p class=align-left>The head of Alleluia Ministries International, Pastor Alph Lukau, left everyone in shock after claiming to have <a href=# title="Pastors in South Africa" rel="nofollow noopener">resurrected</a> a Zimbabwean man. Reports later indicated that the church had gone to several funeral homes to get a hearse, coffin, and sticker. What a great way to act!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/824a44abdd468add.jpg><h3>10. Prophet Paseka Motsoeneng and Jesus selfies</h3><p class=align-left>The pastor of Incredible Happenings Church claimed that he was taken to heaven by God, where he took pictures with Jesus, God, and the angels. He also said Jesus has a beautiful black wife who is Xhosa. He started selling the heavenly pictures which he took with his Samsung S5 at R5,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2f9626c2404453de.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Prophet Bushiri asks for offerings again and gets roasted online</p><h2>Q&A</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some frequently asked questions on South African pastors.</p><h3>Which is the biggest church in South Africa?</h3><p class=align-left>Zion Christian Church(ZCC), with its headquarters at Zion City Moria, has the largest gathering of the faithful across South Africa.
