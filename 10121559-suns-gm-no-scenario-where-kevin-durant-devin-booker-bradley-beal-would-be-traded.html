The Suns then had the best record in the NBA the following season at 64-18, but they were knocked out in the second round.</p><p>That prompted the Suns to make a big in-season trade during the 2022-23 campaign, acquiring Durant and T.J. Warren from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, four first-round picks and a pick swap.</p><p>Injuries limited KD to just eight regular-season games with the Suns last season, though, and Phoenix was once again eliminated in the second round of the playoffs, leading to the firing of head coach Monty Williams.</p><p>Williams was replaced by Frank Vogel, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to their most recent championship in 2020, and Phoenix also made another splash on the trade market.</p><p>Joining a future Hall of Famer in Durant and a four-time All-Star in Booker was a three-time All-Star in Beal, who came over in a trade from the Washington Wizards.</p><p>Phoenix parted ways with future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul in the trade, and they also moved out center Deandre Ayton in a separate three-team deal, bringing in Jusuf Nurkić.</p><p>That essentially left Booker as the last key player remaining from the 2021 Finals team, but there was a lot to like about the new core of Durant, Booker and Beal, along with a supporting cast of Nurkić, Grayson Allen, Eric Gordon and Co.</p><p>However, injuries once again took their toll on the Suns. Durant had his healthiest year since 2018-19 by playing in 75 games, but Beal missed 29 games and Booker missed 14.</p><p>All three of Phoenix's stars played in all four playoff games, combining to average 70.8 points per game, but no other player on the team averaged more than 8.0 points per contest in the series.</p><p>Durant, Booker and Beal are each scheduled to make about $50 million next season, meaning there will be little flexibility to make significant roster changes if all three are kept.</p><p>Even so, Jones seems intent on giving it another go with his Big 3, although they will have a new voice guiding them.</p><p>The Suns fired Vogel after just one season, replacing him with Mike Budenholzer, who led the Bucks to a championship at the expense of the Suns in 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmaCdoWMrKynq12cum66zmaqnJ2elr%2Bqu4ywn56qlWK4psLIp2SdraKWu7V5w56toqZdl7ywt8SrZJuqkZm5psWMm5yapF2svLa4w2aZnmWkp66lscM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
