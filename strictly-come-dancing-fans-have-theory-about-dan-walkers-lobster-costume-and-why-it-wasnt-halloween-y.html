 Halloween Week is one of the most anticipated dates in the Strictly calendar as the wardrobe and makeup departments go all out with an array of fabulously fiendish looks themed around the couples’ routines. The opening dance saw the likes of Voldemort, Pinocchio and Harley Quinn dancing together and fans were full of praise for the teams behind the scenes who dressed up the pairs and judges for fright night."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No extra costs, no contracts.</p><p>Many took to Twitter to share their theories with some even hitting out at the Sheffield born star for not complying with the Halloween theme.</p><p>One viewer questioned: “How is a lobster halloweeny?”</p><p>A second tweeted: “I’m really struggling to see the connection between Halloween and lobsters.”</p><p>A third added: “Dance not too bad considering but song choice and costume awful. Sorry.”</p><p>However, Dan’s army of fans were out in force to defend him.</p><p>One fan tweeted: “Ridiculous that people were angry that Dan and Nadiya had gone for the lobster theme.</p><p>“I have a lot of admiration and respect for Dan standing up for his Christian faith and not following the typical Halloween theme.</p><p>“Hope your family enjoy the Light Party!”</p><p>Another added: “Ignore the weird angry comments… You brighten up the Strictly dancefloor and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>“Love watching you as without any history of dance training you have improved so much, loved the lobsters,” said another supportive fan.</p><p>Dan addressed the comments and thanked viewers for their ongoing support, acknowledging the somewhat “weird and angry” comments.</p><p>He wrote: “So many amazing comments about last night (& a few weird angry ones) Thanks for voting. I know I’m not the best dancer but I’m having a wonderful time learning from @NadiyaBychkova. So much quality on #Strictly this year. I voted for @RoseAylingEllis who is simply tremendous.”</p><p>Strictly Come Dancing will return tonight with the results show as two couples will face the dreaded dance off.</p><p><b><i>To get the latest email updates from Yorkshire Live,</i> </b><b><i>click here</i> </b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq6SntqTAy7JknKedmnqlrc2coKefXZuur7%2BMoZivnV2ptaa70bJkmpqfqsFusMCnZLCZnKCys7%2BMpaabq6Sav26vzqyrrqWVYq6vsIywn7Jlmal6uK3Sp6tmoJGhubDDxJ6lZrFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
