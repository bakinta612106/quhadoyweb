Their plan is for Billy to get closer to Ashley to get information about her Jabot plans. While it looks like Billy is on Jack’s side now, Jason Thompson warns the fans not to get too excited yet. He feels Ashley has a point with Jack’s blind spot with Diane.</p><p>Billy is not comfortable with betraying Ashley to get information about her plans. He loves Ashley and feels an “unmeasurable amount of guilt” over the thought of betraying her. He knows his father, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), would not want him to get involved with a sibling Jabot war.</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say that Billy gave them both time to cool off and find a middle ground. It’s gotten to the point where it is tearing the family company apart, and he feels it’s time for him to do something to save Jabot.</p><p><img alt="The Young And The Restless: Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman)" width=800 height=467 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/07/the-young-and-the-restless-yr-spoilers-billy-turns-on-jack-joins-tucker-and-ashleys-fight-for-jabot/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Young And The Restless (Y&R) Spoilers: Billy Turns On Jack, Joins Tucker, And Ashley’s Fight For Jabot?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/YR-Jack-Abbott.jpg></p><h3>The Young And The Restless Updates – Who’s Side Is Billy Abbott On?</h3><p><a href=#>Billy runs into Ashley and Tucker McCall (Trevor St John)</a> at GCAC and asks if she’s planning to leave Jabot. Ashley informs him she is not only leaving Jabot but encourages him to do the same. She explains that Jack has lost all objectivity where Diane is concerned and believes Diane will soon go after his job so she can run Jabot alongside Jack.</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say that Billy hadn’t considered Diane could want his job. He wants to stop the Abbott family war but must decide whom to trust. Both sides want to use them for their own reasons, but Billy must figure out who he can trust.</p><p>Y&R fans, do you think Diane will go after Billy’s job?
