"New Michigan head coach Dusty May said I was his first recruiting call. That was special."</p><p>"Right now, my primary focus is preparing and practicing for the upcoming McDonald's game and Chipotle Nationals. I am going to hold off any college visits until those basketball events have concluded."</p><p>McNeeley also made clear that he spoke directly with Indiana head coach Mike Woodson to reveal his decommitment.</p><p>"I personally reached out to Indiana, spoke with Coach Mike Woodson and had a direct conversation with him," McNeeley said. "I expressed my utmost respect for Coach Woodson, Indiana University and their devoted fan base."</p><p>McNeeley is a 6'7" small forward who played for Monteverde Academy in Florida alongside Duke commit and No. 1 overall prospect Cooper Flagg.</p><p>McNeeley is a very accomplished player in his own right, earning a spot as the No. 4 ranked player at his position and heading to multiple national showcases for the game's top high school player later this year.</p><p>McNeeley's <a href=# rel=noopener>decommitment</a> from Indiana, which occurred earlier this month, came at a time of uncertainty and struggles for the program.</p><p>Woodson <a href=# rel=noopener>is returning</a>, but that's amid speculation and rumors that the school would part ways after a disappointing campaign that ended with a 27-point loss to Nebraska in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals.</p><p>Indiana ended up finishing 19-14 (10-10 Big Ten) and missed out on the NCAA tournament. As of now, 4-star small forward Bryson Tucker (No. 20 overall) is the only commitment for the <a href=# rel=noopener>class of 2024</a>.</p><p>As for some of McNeeley's new suitors, Houston has become a perennial 30-game winner under head coach Kelvin Sampson and just finished first in the Big 12 regular season standings in its first season in the league. McNeeley would contribute to a great program right away.</p><p>Kentucky has had its share of NCAA tournament struggles in recent years, but the NBA track record continues, with Rob Dillingham and Reed Sheppard both potentially looking like top-five picks in the upcoming <a href=#>NBA draft</a>.</p><p>Per ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeff Borzello</a>, Indiana initially won out over Kansas and Texas. Although Kansas' season ended with a tough second-round loss to Gonzaga, the team is always in the national championship conversation and won one in 2022. Texas is a program that's fared very well of late, including an Elite Eight finish in 2023.</p><p>Ultimately, McNeeley has a host of options as his disposal, and his eventual team will land a promising 5-star prospect who could very well be an NBA lottery pick someday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmGcn%2BMpaCapV2isK%2BxxKWcsmWbmru1wcKksGajkaPAor%2BMpqarnV2drrexjKucmpuYmrFuu9StZJqepJq%2FbrXNnaCappFisaavzqakoqydmru1</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
