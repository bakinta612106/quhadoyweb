Between 2001 and 2006, the pair married. The 50-year-old actress joked in the interview that she felt “entitled” to cheat on Shepard, saying:</p><p>“I was paying all the bills, working my a** hard, and I felt like that’s what it came with.”</p><p>The actress said that neither she nor Howard was ready to commit and that their marriage was a “dumb relationship that should never have gotten out of the dating phase.”</p><p>Fans were shocked by Union’s revelation of infidelity. It generated a discussion on the internet about what would happen if the positions were reversed. Twitter user @mikeyperk had this to say about it:</p><h2>“How does that even correlate?”: Gabrielle Union’s podcast interview ignites online discussion</h2><p>Following the publication of the Armchair Expert Podcast, netizens chastised the actress from Cheaper by the Dozen for her remarks. One Twitter user, @NSRd4tmsz, asked whether the actress was correct in cheating, implying that if a guy “pays all the expenses, he too should be entitled to cheat freely”: Many others emphasized that “paying debts” does not imply “infidelity.” Some people reacted by saying that the 50-year-argument old’s also implied that a spouse is only “liked and respected” if he has “money” and “provides for the family.” Others questioned her logic, labeling it “wrong” and “stupid.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gabrielle-Union-1.jpg alt="Gabrielle Union" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Some internet users were outraged at both couples’ infidelity and claimed that “nobody should cheat.” Others questioned the rationale for being married when neither party was interested in being together.</p><p>Finally, numerous people pointed out that the Being Mary Jane actress had been misquoted and that just a portion of her podcast interview had been released. They argue that since Chris Howard cheated before Gabrielle Union, it is unjust to single out the actress.</p><p>One user, @maresarustla, argued that Union’s “done in jest” statements were overblown. She said, ”</p><p>“If you listen to the whole Armchair Expert show with Gabrielle Union, you’ll see that the unjustly aggregated statement was made (in fun) amid a complex talk about infidelity, to which Dax also gave tales, imbalanced relationships, developed views on marriage, and so on.”</p><p>Other Twitterati thoughts regarding misquoting and distorting remarks are shown below:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Agenda >>> facts on this streets..the Gabrielle Union issue further confirms it…Babe literally said she felt entitled to cheat BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WAS ALREADY CHEATING while providing absolutely nothing and twitter twisted everything..Omo!!!</p><p>— Arógóménìté Ujatólì🇨🇵 (@Iamkunevrizzy) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 4, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>All Gabrielle Union said was her ex husband was a cheater who had the audacity the cheat when she was paying all the bills & supporting the household — so she got her lick back.

Union chose not to continue in an unpleasant marriage that was destructive to both parties after a short visit with a couples’ counselor, where the therapist determined that the pair had no similar principles, beliefs, or scruples. Gabrielle Union married Dwyane Wade in 2014, and the pair adopted a daughter through surrogacy in 2018.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiempqinrKtuMRmrKehn6N6tMDIq6pmraBisLC606umr52iqMZuw8itn2aglad6s7HArKanZZakv26vx56YraGenHqwuoyhnKtllp6%2FtMCMoaysmpGjsXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
