So when you’re shopping for nine-to-five footwear, it’s key to look for style and&nbsp;function. Whether you prefer to rock flats or sneakers, clogs or slip-ons, we found the best shoes for walking and standing all day that you don’t want to overlook on your search.</p><h2>What to look for in a good walking and standing shoe</h2><p>Board-certified podiatrist Patrick McEneaney, DPM, has three criteria he asks every patient to follow when shopping for shoes. First is fit. “You want to make sure that the shoe fits adequately. It should be wide enough in the front, but not too wide in the back,” says Dr. McEneaney. If the back of your footwear isn’t snug enough, it will cause your feet to rub and may result in blisters. And conversely, if the shoes is too narrow, it will squeeze your toes and cause joint pain. You’re looking for the goldilocks shoe that fits just right.</p><p>Support is also important, says Dr. McEneaney. Rather than going for a shoe that’s the foamy, squishy equivalent of wearing clouds on your feet, he recommends picking up something foamy, yet firm. “[Squishy] shoes feel comfy initially, but they may lead to chronic overuse problems or can actually accentuate preexisting problems,” says Dr. McEneaney. So when you’re shopping, think: “I want clouds, but, like, Hollywood-style clouds that I can actually stand on.”</p><p>Lastly, Dr. McEneaney recommends picking something up that has a stiff midsole. “So when you look at the bottom of the shoe, the middle one-third should be stiff and difficult to bend. The more that it bends, the more it’s going to load pressure from the back of the foot to the front of the foot. If the shoe has some more stiffness, it’s gonna load the pressure through the shoe, and take some of that stress off the middle of the foot,” says Dr. McEneaney. You don’t want foot stress on top of work stress… that’s for sure.</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>Now that you’re equipped with the intel you need, you’re ready for The Great American Pastime.

I usually have to switch out shoes during a 12-hour shift of being on my feet, but with these shoes, my feet don’t hurt at all after 16 hours on my feet.” Enough said. We’ve written at length about the<span> magic of Hoka</span>, especially why they<span>make such a good walking shoe. </span>Our senior commerce editor even swears by them for her <span>three-mile dog daily dog walks</span>.</p><p>Hoka’s generally run a little bit large, so bear that in mind when you order your pair.</p><h2>The 3 Best Shoes for Standing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/techloompro-black-heathergrey-white-1_1200x.jpeg><p>APL Women’s TechLoom Pro — $160.00</p><p>Designed for running, the APL Women’s TechLoom is a dream for standing around all day.
