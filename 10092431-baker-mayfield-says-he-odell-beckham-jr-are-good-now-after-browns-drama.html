That ranked third among all NFL quarterback-receiver duos.</p><p>Mayfield was much more accurate when throwing to other Browns catchers, Trotter noted. His Total Quarterback Rating when throwing to Beckham between was 58.0, compared to 85.2 combined when throwing to all other targets over that span.</p><p>That mismatch on the field led to Odell Beckham Sr. posting a video on the day of the 2021 trade deadline highlighting a series of Mayfield's <a href=# rel=noopener>missed throws</a> to Beckham. The Browns ended up restructuring Beckham's deal and releasing him in November 2021 to sign with the Los Angeles Rams.</p><p>Beckham <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> the following February that he had not spoken with Mayfield since his departure from the Browns.</p><p>"Like I said earlier about closing doors and being able to have closure, that conversation I'm sure it will be at some point in life," <a href=# rel=noopener>Beckham said</a>.</p><p>That August, however, Beckham left a <a href=# rel=noopener>supportive comment</a> regarding Mayfield's debut with the Carolina Panthers.</p><p>The Buccaneers and Baltimore Ravens are not set to face each other this season, so Mayfield and Beckham will not be reuniting on the field. The good news is, their relationship seems to be improving off of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWeBdH2Mm5iknaJiuqLFxaKcpZxdqK66v4yhnGanlJq5rXnBnpqkoJGiequ%2BjJqpnmWXpLylec2ormaZlqmys3nBq6awpqNisbOtzJo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
