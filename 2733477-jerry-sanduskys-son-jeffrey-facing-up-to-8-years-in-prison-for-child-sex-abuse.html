We are happy that these girls can move forward and experience a life with adults that deserve their trust.”</p><p>Police began investigating Sandusky last year when he sent lewd text messages to an underage girl. Another underage girl was also abused in 2013. The girl from the 2016 case was 16 years old at the time and the daughter of a woman Sandusky was dating. The other girl was 15.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBrY2mEeHnJnqmrsV2orq%2Bw1KyisqtdqLyvecmenZ%2Bqla56p63CoqWgZaWlerW7jHFksp2Rp8Butc1mp6uho6S7brLOq2ScoJmhsW6%2FxLFkmpqlqLI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
