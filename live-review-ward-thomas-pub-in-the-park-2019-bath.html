Their slick delivery and effortless harmonies wowed the audience and instantly won them a host of new fans in the process.</p><p>Their barnstorming set also included the foot stomping ‘Same Love’ and heartfelt, soaring ‘Hopeless’. A mix of old and new with a combination of pop-tinged anthems and sweet country ballads allowed for Ward Thomas to demonstrate their incredible talents.</p><p>The 25-year-old twins who made chart history back in 2016 when their sophomore LP ‘<a href=#>Cartwheels</a>‘ topped the Offical UK Album Top 40 Chart also made time to sing Happy Birthday to their live session guitarist Billy Adamson, much to his blushing discomfort.</p><p>The Pub In The Park crowd were in great spirits and sang the Birthday song in unison with the twins and their band. This made for an intimate moment and showcased the sweetness and easy charm Catherine and Lizzy possess.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/live-review-ward-thomas-@-pub-in-the-park-2019-bath-01-300x225.jpg><p>Their 40 minute set also included a number of tracks off their latest top-ten hit album ‘<a href=#>Restless Minds</a>‘, such as the anthemic, ‘I Believe In You’ which had the entire audience participating in a sing-off competition for the ‘you’re on your way, yeah you’re” pre-chorus, newest single ‘One More Goodbye’ that showcased the girls’ spine-tingling vocals, and the honest ‘No Filter’ which Catherine gave an inspirational speech about how festivals are a safe space to be entirely who you want to be without judgment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/live-review-ward-thomas-@-pub-in-the-park-2019-bath-03-300x225.jpg><p>Older material also delighted the packed crowd with Ward Thomas delivering a euphoric medley of songs off their independent debut LP ‘<a href=#>From Where We Stand</a>‘. The heady mix of ‘The Good And The Right’, ‘Town Called Ugley’, and ‘Push For The Stride’ allowed for major audience participation and got the entire park on their feet singing and clapping along.</p><p>Along with performing a collection of their original hits, the UK country duo also made time in their packed live set for a sublime cover of Bob Dylan’s ‘Make You Feel My Love’. This poignant song was dedicated to a bride to be in the audience who was on her Hen night.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a better cover than that of Adele, but these girls gave a rich and warm version allowing for their sweeping vocals to wash over the crowd and made for hair standing up moment.</p><p>Their live set was closed out with crossover smash and major fan favoruite ‘Carry You Home’. This delighted the Pub In The Park crowd and they exited the stage to loud whistles and cheers and a whole host of new fans.</p><p>It’s been incredible to see the growth of Ward Thomas, and their on-stage confidence since we first saw them live in <a href=#>Cardiff</a> back in 2016. They are a polished live act that consistently delivers high energy sets mixed with stripped back intimate moments and last night they performed a set of seasoned professions.</p><p>Gone are the shy girls who once just stood in the centre of the stage, and in their place are two confident women who know how to put on a show that will have people lavishing them with praise long after they leave the spotlight.</p><p>Last night they cemented their place as one of the top live acts on the scene right now and thanks to their divine harmonies and sweet personalities fans of all ages are able to bask in their performances.</p><p><strong>RATING: 5/5</strong></p><p><strong>Did you see Ward Thomas at Pub In The Park on June 22nd?
