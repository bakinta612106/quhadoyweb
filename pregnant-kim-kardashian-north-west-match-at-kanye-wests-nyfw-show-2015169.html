The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 34, who is expecting her second child, a son, with West in December, donned a bump-hugging nude bodysuit, paired with a complementary Haider Ackermann trench. She slicked her hair back into a low ponytail, and wore understated makeup, including a neutral lip."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She finished her ensemble with a high ponytail that showcased her natural curls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the show, West, 38, who jokingly announced that he would be running for president in 2020 at the VMAs last month, presented his latest Yeezy capsule collection for Adidas, which featured dystopian-esque dresses, jackets, and leggings, all in earth tones. Naturally, his wife and daughter excitedly watched the whole presentation from their front-row seats alongside Kardashian’s sisters, <strong>Kourtney</strong> and <strong>Khloe</strong>, Vogue‘s <strong>Anna Wintour</strong>, and <strong>Lorde</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of course, not everyone was so enthusiastic about West’s latest fashion week offering. The “FourFiveSeconds” rapper ruffled some feathers earlier this week when he decided to add his show to the lineup last minute, choosing the same time—Wednesday at 12 noon—that designers <strong>Naeem Khan</strong> and <strong>Anne Bowen</strong> had already scheduled for their presentations.</p><p>Bowen, for one, made sure that the intrusion didn’t go unnoticed. Speaking out to Women’s Wear Daily, she said, “Kanye knows he is a media sensation and it is just not ethical to do this. It’s like we are David and he is Goliath. We have put our heart and soul into our show, and should not be stepped on like this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK7sL7ToWSwnaOpeq6t05yfZpmkYriiutieZLCdo6nAbrrYn65mq5ikxG5%2Bj2psam5p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
