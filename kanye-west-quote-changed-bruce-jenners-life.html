I can have the most beautiful little daughter in the world, and I have that. But I’m nothing if I can’t be me. If I can’t be true to myself, they don’t mean anything.</strong>” It looks like Mr. West really isn’t as bad as he seems.</p><p>Since then, Kim has been extremely supportive of her step-father, and has even offered to give him some of her expert fashion advice. &nbsp;After all, as a part of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, he’s going to have some pretty stiff competition.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images for The Lopez Foundation)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtZKqtn6mybq%2FHmqWgnZRir7PBwp5ko52eo7Kzv4yloJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
