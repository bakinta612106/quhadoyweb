Instead of lying on the beach or enjoying summer fun with friends and family, the former talk show host wed her fiancé in a very intimate ceremony. After two years of dating and a September engagement, Couric and John Molner exchanged vows in their own back yard. As if weddings aren’t already intimate and personal, the couple invited only 50 guests to witness the exchanging of their view.</p><p>“We wanted to keep the wedding just very low-key. This is not my first rodeo so I didn’t want to go too crazy and neither did John,” Couric said of the event. Couric was married previously to Jay Monahan, who passed away in 1998 after battling colon cancer, with whom she had two daughters. Ellie and Carrie, 22 and 18 respectively, were on hand to celebrate with their mother and her new husband at the intimate Hamptons affair. Molner’s two children were also present for the wedding.</p><p>In keeping with the theme of an intimate and personal affair, Couric decided to throw tradition to the wind by trying on wedding dresses with her now-husband present. It would probably horrify most brides, but Couric did not make a big deal of choosing her wedding gown. In fact, she wasn’t even sure what she was wearing to her wedding until last week when she tried on several gowns in front of Molner, who helped her choose a gown by designer Carmen Marc Valvo. The dress was a Chantilly lace halter with beading in ivory.</p><p>Also not following typical bridal tradition, Couric’s fiancé was more involved in the wedding planning process than she due to her busy schedule at the beginning of the year, which included the final taping of her talk show and her daughter’s high school graduation.</p><p>(Photo by Andrew H.
