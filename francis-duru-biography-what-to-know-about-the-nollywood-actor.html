Francis originally hails from Imo State but grew up with his parents in Cameroon, the western part of Africa. No record shows whether he has siblings or not.</p><p>Francis spent the bulk of his early years in Cameroon, where he completed both his primary and secondary school. After obtaining his West African Senior School Certificate, he moved to Nigeria to pursue his tertiary education. He got admission to study at the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and in 1992, he graduated with a B.Sc. Honors in Theatre Arts.</p><p>Meanwhile, young Francis was actively involved in school drama clubs during his undergraduate days. Also, because he was studying theatre arts, he took part in many stage plays and performing arts. Hence, it was not difficult for him to fit into the film industry when he fully ventured into it after all.</p><h2><strong>Francis Duru Has Been Active in the Film Industry Since 1989</strong></h2><p>On returning to Nigeria, even before he gained admission into the University, Francis discovered his interest in acting. This was what prompted him to apply for the Theatre Arts course at UNIPORT. He joined Nollywood in 1989 and started going for movie auditions. In the same year, he landed his debut in the movie titled Missing Mark, directed by the Late Ndubisi Oko.</p><p>Though his role in the movie did not give him enough prominence he desired, it shot him into the limelight, and from there, he continued to get minor characters in movies. However, Francis became a household name in Nollywood in 1994 after featuring in an action-comedy film, Rattle Snake. Produced by Amaka Igwe, Rattle Snake was rated the best-produced movie in Nigeria.</p><p>The movie, wherein Francis played a significant role as Ahanna, exposes the dangers of an uncaring society on a growing child, child negligence, and abuse. Rattle Snake later won him an award for Most Promising Actor in Nigeria at the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards and Best New Actor at the Africa Movie Academy Awards.</p><p>Another movie that skyrocketed his fame in Nollywood was Odum Na Akwaeke, where he acted as Ogbuagu. The movie also earned him a nomination for Best Actor in an Indigenous Movie (Non-English Speaking) at the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award. In 2011, he was honored by the Nigerian government as a Member of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR)</p><p>With more than 200 movies, Francis Duru, a recipient of the United Nations Ambassador of Peace award, has remained relevant and in demand in his acting career. He mostly features in romantic and comedy movies and plays the role of a responsible husband and father. Regardless, he can also fit into any movie role given to him.</p><h3><strong>List of Francis Duru’s Movies and TV Shows</strong></h3><ul><li>Mboputa</li><li>Always Mine</li><li>Stigma</li><li>Nnenda</li><li>Home In Exile</li><li>Entanglement</li><li>One On One</li><li>Worst Enemy</li><li>Laviva</li><li>The Good Husband</li><li>Rattle Snake</li><li>Breaking Heart</li><li>Missing Mark</li><li>Final War</li><li>Gods Of No Mercy</li><li>Great Ambassadors</li><li>House In Crisis</li><li>Love And Likeness</li><li>Bless My Soul</li><li>Lumba Boys</li><li>Persecution</li><li>Rhythm Of Love</li><li>Short Of Time</li><li>Silent Whispers</li><li>Total War</li><li>Warriors Of Satan</li><li>Will Of God</li><li>Personal Assignment</li><li>Clash Of Interest</li><li>Forces Of Nature</li><li>Royal Grandmother</li><li>My Girl Friend</li><li>My Little Secret</li><li>Soul Engagement, 1,2 & 3</li><li>Sound Of Love 1 & 2</li><li>Sweet Sound 1 & 2</li><li>Tears From Holland 1& 2</li><li>Upside Down</li><li>Without Apology</li></ul><h2><strong>Actor Francis Duru is actively Involved in Philanthropic Works</strong></h2><p>Francis is largely involved in various acts of charity which focus more on alleviating poverty and improving the lives of children in Africa.

Like the actor, Adokiye is also a graduate of Theatre Arts from the University of Port Harcourt, so the duo met at the University and in the same department.</p><p>According to the actor, he was in his final year while Adokiye had just come in as a new student.&nbsp;They fell in love, dated for a few years, and tied the knot in a white wedding ceremony in 2003. Speaking about how his marriage journey has been so far, actor Francis Duru confessed that bliss is simply the order of the day in his home, and he is thankful to God for that.</p><p>Meanwhile, apart from posting their photos on social media, Francis keeps the information about his wife and children out of public knowledge.

Francis Duru has not quit acting; he is still active in the film industry but is scarcely seen lately. Francis is surely not familiar to the younger generations as he has not been acting in modern Nollywood films.</p><p>Since 2018, after directing and featuring in the movie, Spiritual Dark Light, Duru has remained very scarce on the big screens. However, Even though he might seem to have been forgotten, Francis is without a doubt one of the legendary actors that dominated Nollywood from its early times and positively influenced the industry in a lot of ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57xauYp5uZqHqlwdGuZJuhn5y%2ForzHsmSwoJGperW7jKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmq6GdXaO8rbjYsKaonF2WsLW70Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
