Conor Maynard In An &amp;quot;Old Town Road&amp;quot; Sing-Off</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-10</div><p>We adore Conor Maynard’s sing-offs on his YouTube Channel and our favourites totally include the “<a href=#>Despacito</a>” one he did with Pixie Lott and the “<a href=#>Shape Of You</a>” one with The Vamps. It’s been a while since he released a new sing-off, but it has certainly been worth the wait as he has recruited non-other than the incredible singer JoJo for a sing-off of Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road”.</p><p>Before kicking off the sing-off, Conor Maynard and JoJo undertake a lie detector test, where Conor Maynard confesses his love of JoJo – trying to play it cool at first until the buzzer makes him confess all. It’s a great sketch to start the video off, and really sets the mood for the songs they picked in the sing-off.</p><p>Their choice of song for the sing-off is the current UK number one, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road”, which is also the current US Billboard Hot 100 number one too. Guess people are loving this track on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Kicking it all off is Conor Maynard singing 3Oh!3’s “Don’t Trust Me”, leading into JoJo singing Katy Perry’s “I Kissed A Girl”. They continue back and forth covering tracks such as CeeLo Green’s “F**k You”, Frank Ocean’s “We All Try”, Khalid’s “Talk”, Mike Posner’s “Cooler Than Me” – which Conor Maynard uses to flirt with JoJo and then she threw it back with Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” – Foster The People’s “Pumped Up Kicks”, and Kanye West’s “All Of The Lights”.</p><p>There are plenty of stand-out moments throughout, certainly JoJo’s rendition of Hozier’s “Take Me To Church” – which sounded amazing, Conor Maynard’s version of Nickelback’s “Rockstar” – which suited his vocals, JoJo’s astonishing voice on Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ “Can’t Hold Us” featuring Ray Dalton, and Conor Maynard’s cheeky rendition of Ginuwine’s “Pony” – who doesn’t like this song? As well as JoJo’s riffs at the very end of the video.</p><p>We also have to especially mention Conor Maynard singing JoJo’s debut hit “Leave (Get Out)” which has JoJo giggling as if she wasn’t expecting it, and her brilliant remix of Drake’s “Marvin’s Room” – we adore the full version to this so if you ever get the chance to hear it we highly suggest you should.</p><p>They end the track by singing Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road (Remix)” which features Billy Ray Cyrus, together. Their voices melt as one perfectly, making us hope that one day they’ll collaborate on a song together as their harmonies will certainly be incredible.</p><h3>Watch JoJo Vs.

This will follow up her refreshed versions of her first two albums JoJo and&nbsp;The High Road, as well as the refreshed versions of the songs “Disaster” and “Demonstrate” as her early record label (the one which stopped her from releasing music for all those years) had removed the albums and singles from download and streaming sites. We adored her third album Mad Love. and we cannot wait for this new album she’s working on.</p><h4>What do you make of the JoJo Vs. Conor Maynard sing-off to Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road”?
