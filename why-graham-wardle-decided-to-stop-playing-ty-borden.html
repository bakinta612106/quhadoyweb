We care about each other very much, we have been working together for over a decade. So I guess the next step was, ‘How do we do this and honour that character the best way we can?’”</p><p>Marshall also shared with The Chronicle Journal her hopes for exploring Amy’s journey as a widow.</p><p>“I actually have a close friend that was widowed and her journey was heartbreaking, but it was a real story, it was a real journey,” Marshall told The Chronicle Journal. “And I think this story, even though it’s going to be heartbreaking, there is that moment of strength and growth and light out of it.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Scott Disick’s Former Modeling Career Included Book Covers</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2ByZZenrqmtzGaumqqUobJusMScoJ2dlGLBsHnSraapZaChrrq1zaBkrbFdl7yzsMSnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
