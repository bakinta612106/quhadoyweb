Last season, they actually won a playoff series, which was just the second time they have done so since the 1999-2000 campaign.</p><p>New York has routinely missed out on the league's marquee free agents during Dolan's ownership, and still remains a step behind many of the best teams in the Eastern Conference, meaning the drought likely won't end in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWV%2BeoWMpKWim5uoerOtzaCcq6tdn66usdJmm6ikkaN6pbvErKWtZaKarq242GajoqOVYry4usinnmaslZa6tHnWqKWtZZGZsW65zquc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
