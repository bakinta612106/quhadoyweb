Zayn looked confused and possibly even upset by the turn of events as he watched while his former friend was put through the announce table.</p><p>While Reigns entered the Royal Rumble PPV as the favorite to beat Owens and extend his nearly 900-day title run, questions about Zayn's allegiances created at least some doubt.</p><p>The Tribal Chief did manage to retain, but the post-match events have left many more chapters of the Reigns-Zayn-Owens story to be told.</p><p><i>Listen to </i>Ring Rust Radio<i> for all of the hot wrestling topics.
