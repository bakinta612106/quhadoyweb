We’re loving the album and think you will too, here’s why:</strong></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>MØ, who has worked with the likes of <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> and Diplo, is a European pop star in her own right. In terms of solo music, she is now two albums in with her delayed sophomore album, ‘Forever Neverland’ being her most recent body of work. Towards the album’s release, we received the Diplo-produced single, ‘Sun In Our Eyes’ along with the ‘When I Was Young’ EP a year prior, amongst other promotional singles including <a href=#>‘Nostalgia’</a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This may have not been the most conventional method in releasing a sophomore album four years later, following up from her debut album, ‘No Mythologies To Follow’ which was released back in March 2014. However, MØ is far from conventional with ‘Forever Neverland’ pulling out all the stops to prove that. The album features previously mentioned singles, a Charli XCX collaboration amongst other features. MØ has previously worked with XCX on her 2017 mixtapes, <a href=#>‘Number 1 Angel’</a> and <a href=#>‘Pop 2’</a>.</span></p><p></p><p>MØ’s sudden rise to musical fame with ‘No Mythologies To Follow’ catapulted to worldwide acclaim, both commercial and critical. Throughout her debut run, it was the first time in forever we had seen a Danish pop star make it on a global scale. It feels abnormal to call MØ a pop star as she is way&nbsp;more than just that. She’s a game changer, if you like.</p><p>Whilst it is rather strange looking back at the duration it took for ‘Forever Neverland’ to see the light of day, this could’ve been down to label issues or even MØ just being a perfectionist. It will be rather interesting seeing how MØ’s musical career pans out in the near future.</p><p><strong>You can purchase and stream MØ’s sophomore album, ‘Forever Neverland’ <a href=#>now</a>:</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>What do you think of MØ and her sophomore album, ‘Forever Neverland’?&nbsp;Let us know on&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;@<a href=#>CelebMix</a></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kurB5xaipnq6Vp3qvsdWeqaWZnpl6tLvPoaamp6KaeqK4wa6kaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
