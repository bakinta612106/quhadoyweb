His mother was born in North Carolina.</p><p>The couple gave up acting and sought careers that would enable them to support their expanding family after falling in love, working on stage together for many years, and getting married.</p><p>The actor, on the other hand, has not spoken much about his parents, and as a result, not much is known about them. This could be because his parents might want a simple life away from the spotlight.</p><p>Throughout elementary school, White studied ballet, jazz, and tap dancing. At the age of 13, after enrolling in a brand-new middle school dance program, he had a change of heart and decided to pursue acting. White was cast as Phillip “Lip” Gallagher on Shameless right out of high school.</p><p>Jeremy is American-born and of Caucasian heritage. Jeremy is a Christian and is born under the astrological sign of Aquarius.</p><h2>Who Is Addison Timlin the Wife of Jeremy Allen White?</h2><p>Jeremy Allen White wed Addison Timlin on October 18, 2019.</p><p>While shooting “Afterschool” as teenagers, Jeremy and actress Addison Timlin became friends (The movie was nominated for the 2008 Independent Spirit Awards). Addison plays Hillary Clinton in the 2018 independent film “When I’m a Moth.”</p><p>They were good friends for a very long time before they started dating.

Allen routinely shares pictures of his wife and daughter on his official Instagram account.</p><p>The actor has not mentioned his family or whether he has any, therefore it is difficult to determine if he has siblings. On the other hand, Jeremy’s family appears to be proud of him and encouraging of his accomplishment.</p><p>When Jeremy went to an audition for a role in shameless, he had just graduated from high school. He participated in the casting process for the roles of Ian and Lip Gallagher (the yare brothers on the show).
