In his final budget before he leaves office, Curry focused on parks and development along the river and downtown, including the former site of The Jacksonville Landing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The now vacant lot could be Curry’s legacy mark on Jacksonville. As part of his final budget, the mayor proposed a $25 million investment for a new park at the site.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The plans for the park, particularly a “Jax” statue, have drawn some criticism (and comedy), but the mayor said it demonstrates his commitment to a series of river parks.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF"><b>RELATED: </b><b>Design plan featuring massive ‘Jax’ sculpture picked for former Jacksonville Landing site</b><b> | </b><b>Company pokes fun at new Jacksonville statue by creating ‘Lerp?’ socks</b></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Curry is also budgeting $15 million for Metro Park renovations,&nbsp;$7 million for extending the Riverwalk to&nbsp;Metro Park and helping to relocate the&nbsp;Museum of Science and History — MOSH — to the new Kids Kampus&nbsp;being developed&nbsp;across from the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office headquarters downtown where the Fire Museum has been moved and where the USS Orleck will eventually be docked.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“You can’t be a suburb of nowhere. That’s what I’ve been preaching. And it’s taken a long time to prepare downtown to where it is today, which is right for development all along the riverfront,” Curry said. “I expect the next mayor and the next council will be cutting a lot of ribbons over the next eight years that we laid the groundwork for, and I’ll be happy to see that.”</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The mayor has much more money to work with this year. With&nbsp;property values going up, the city is bringing in close to $100 million more to spend on various programs. That is why the mayor wants to roll back the property tax rate slightly.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Most were excited to hear about the property tax rollback. Although it really won’t be noticeable — amounting to a little more than $18 for a $200,000 home — it is a savings. News4JAX asked the mayor after his budget address why the tax rate wasn’t rolled back even more so people could see even more savings.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“It’s the first tax cut since 2007. We are financially sound right now. I talked about that in my budget address. With the guidance and advice of my financial folks — my CFO and my CAO — this was a responsible tax cut,” Curry said. “It will also allow us to continue to increase our reserve. We have lived through in Jacksonville an economic crisis where city government was squeezed and constrained, and they couldn’t provide services and they laid people off. We have set the city of Jacksonville up for the next mayor and the next council for whatever may come with them.”</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">As for the overall budget, council members say it’s heading in the right direction.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“It’s addressing infrastructure, riverfront parks, our disadvantaged population, the neighborhoods that need more public core, the streets, the drainage, the curbs and gutters,” City Councilman Matt Carlucci said.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">But not everyone is happy. The Northside Coalition issued a statement Thursday, saying the weakest part of the mayor’s budget is the fact that it does not direct JSO to be more accountable for how its money is spent.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF"><b>RELATED:</b><b> $37M budget increase request for JSO won’t mean more officers on streets, interim sheriff says</b></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">It will now be up to City Council to decide where the budget will go and how the money will actually be spent. They will begin their reviews next month.</p><p>Copyright 2022 by WJXT News4JAX – All rights reserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnZbGsL6MnKyrqqlivbOx0p6lratdZnp2roybrJ2flal6sb7OqaasmZxiwbB5yZqapKufo8OquMueZJyhpK56pLvUp5qipF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
