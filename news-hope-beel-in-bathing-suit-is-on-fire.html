"I had never actively lifted weights to gain muscle so it was all new to me," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Women Fitness</span></a><span>. "I was the girl who ate pizza and ran 5 miles to try to stay in shape. Little did I know that I would fall in love with the lifestyle and take my fitness career to a whole new level after my first competition."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/HopeBeel2.png><p><span>Hope loves "to mix it up," when it comes to exercise. "I think it's important to keep your muscles guessing. Typically I'll do three weight training days, 2 classes; kickboxing, Pilates, or spin, and 1 high intensity cardio day," she told Women Fitness. "Morning workout in Mexico," she captioned this workout snap.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/shutterstock_590825882.jpg><p><span>"My diet is based off balance," Hope dished to Women Fitness. "Typically throughout the week I'll have lean protein, complex carbs, and veggies. I try to eat every 2-3 hours." She is also a fan of cheat meals, "and I don't deprive myself from anything," she added. "I believe that once you take things out of your diet for a period of time and try to put them back in, you create food allergies. Plus, I maintain my physique year round, so having balance in my diet has been very helpful."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/HopeBeel4.png><p><span>Before Hope got into fitness she didn't have great skin. "I think diet plays an important role in beautiful skin and hair. Also, drinking plenty of water," she told Women Fitness.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/HopeBeel5.png><p><span>Hope doesn't encourage rapid weight loss. "I always stress that this journey takes time and it's important to do it slow and steady. Accomplishing short term goals helps you get to your main goal," she told Women Fitness.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoaegmnqjscSlZKKmXZeutbTIp55mq6WewW610mamp2WWnr%2Bmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
