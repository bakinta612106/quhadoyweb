In an effort to avoid civil liability after a mass shooting, Michigan’s Oxford Community Schools on Friday legally blamed alleged murderer Ethan Crumbley and his parents for a November 2021 massacre that left four dead and seven injured.
According to a “notice of non-party fault” filed in federal court, defense lawyers pointed the finger at Crumbley and his parents, James Crumbley and Jennifer Crumbley, in one of several civil lawsuits filed against the district and its staff."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

[w]e want our parents and students to know that there has been no threat to our building nor our students.”</p><p>41.&nbsp; On or about November 16, 2021, days prior to the actual incident, multiple parents of students provided communications to Defendant WOLF with concerns about threats to students made on social media, and the incident of the severed animal heads at Oxford High School, the two weeks before.</p><p>The response filing by the defendants elsewhere denied that several administrators had reviewed Crumbley’s social media posts prior to the shooting, denied that administrators had “actual knowledge of concerns from parents” about threats on campus, denied that they knew Crumbley allegedly brought the severed bird’s head to school, denied that administrators knew of “Crumbley’s violent tendencies and ideations,” denied sending “correspondence and emails to parents” that asserted that the “children were safe” in the days before the shooting, and denied telling people to “stop reporting, sharing, or otherwise discussing” threatening material.</p><p>Elsewhere, the district and its staff, via their attorneys, denied the allegations that Crumbley brought live ammunition to the school and “openly displayed” it in a classroom on Nov. 29, denied that Crumbley was “searching for ammunition on his cell phone during class” on that same date, and denied that one administrator “left a voicemail” for Jennifer Crumbley “regarding Ethan Crumbley’s inappropriate internet search.”</p><p>Further on, the defendants denied that a teacher “observed Ethan viewing violent videos of shootings and notified” administrators by email of what was occurring.</p><p>The defendants then denied that a teacher caught Crumbley drawing “horrific images” on his math assignment — something criminal prosecutors and the plaintiffs have long alleged.&nbsp; Here’s the original accusation from the civil suit (paragraph 90):</p><p>On the morning of November 30, 2021, Defendant ALLISON KARPINSKI discovered horrific drawings on assignments left on Ethan Crumbley’s desk, after Ethan was caught searching for and watching violent shooting videos on his phone. These horrific writings and drawings, and Ethan’s watching of shooting videos, were reported to Defendant EJAK and Defendant SHAWN HOPKINS. Defendant MORGAN took a picture of said note with her cell phone.</p><p>“[T]hey are untrue,” the lawsuit said in response while denying the paragraph’s assertions in whole cloth fashion.</p><p><a href=#>Hopkins testified in a pretrial criminal hearing</a> in late February that Crumbley claimed to have been watching violent video games in class.&nbsp; Hopkins said he discussed the violent drawings with Crumbley directly and asked the teen’s parents to pick Ethan up from school to take him home.</p><p>The defendants — that is, the district and several named employees — further denied&nbsp; that they had made a “knowing and deliberate decision to leave, unsearched, Ethan Crumbley’s backpack, even after discovering the alarming note authored by Crumbley.”&nbsp; And, accordingly, the defendants denied that administrator <strong>Nicholas Ejak</strong> “brought him [Crumbley] his backpack without searching it” after Crumbley had been brought to the office but before the shooting.</p><p>The defendants further denied threatening to call Child Protective Services if Crumbley’s parents did not seek counseling for Crumbley “within 48 hours” of when he was allegedly caught making the violent drawings.</p><p>Hopkins testified that he did, however, have communications with the Crumbley parents on this topic.</p><p>“I want him seen within 48 hours,” Hopkins <a href=#>testified that he told Jennifer Crumbley</a>.&nbsp; “I will be following up.”</p><p>In criminal court proceedings, Crumbley’s parents have <a href=#>contested that narrative</a>; their attorneys have said they were given the “option” to leave Ethan in school and, ergo, assumed that the school had things under control.</p><p>As to a paragraph (119), which described the ensuing shooting as a “massacre,” this school district paused its usual drumbeat of unknowingness or blanket denial to state the following:</p><p>Defendants further state that its ALICE [active shooter] emergency response to the situation presented on November 30 saved lives. Oxford High School administration, including Principal Steve Wolf, Kristy Gibson-Marshall, and Kurt Nuss ran toward the incident, unarmed, to effectively save children, administer aid to injured parties, and to locate the perpetrator, putting themselves in harm’s way.</p><p>The defendants then asserted a broad collection of affirmative defenses to the allegations:</p><p>Defendants affirmatively state that they were guided by and strictly observed all legal duties and obligations imposed by operation of law and otherwise. Further, all actions of their agents, servants and/or employees were careful, prudent, proper and lawful.</p><p>[ . . . ]</p><p>Defendants were engaged in the performance of governmental functions and, therefore, are immune from suit for civil damages for this claim pursuant to the principles of governmental immunity as set forth in case law and the statutes of this State.</p><p>The defendants also said they were protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p><p>“Defendants are not liable to Plaintiffs for the criminal, assaultive acts of third parties,” they also posited.</p><p>Plus, they said, “Plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the Michigan Revised School Code.”</p><p>“Plaintiffs’ claim fails as a matter of law and fact because Defendants were not required to protect Plaintiffs from the violence or other mishaps that are not directly attributable to the conduct of its employees,” the affirmative defenses continued.</p><p>The defense reply asked the judge overseeing the matter to “enter an order of no cause of action as to Defendants, together with costs and attorney fees so wrongfully sustained.”&nbsp; In other words, the school district and the other individual defendants want the victims of the shooting to pay for, in their opinion, erroneously dragging the case into the courthouse at all.</p><p>Ethan Crumbley&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>accused in the state’s criminal courts of murdering</a>&nbsp;<strong>Hana St. Juliana</strong>, 14,&nbsp;<strong>Tate Myre</strong>, 16, and&nbsp;<strong>Madisyn Baldwin</strong>, 17, on the day of the shooting; he’s also charged with murdering&nbsp;<strong>Justin Shilling</strong>, 17, who died the morning after the attack.
