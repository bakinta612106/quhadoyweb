According to SNY's Ian Begley, &#34;As of earlier this week, the Knicks were said to be steadfast in holding to their own price point for any top players available via trade, including Damian Lillard&#34; or James Harden.
Both Harden and Lillard requested to be traded from the Philadelphia 76ers and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively, earlier this offseason."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Begley pointed out that "it's fair to assume the Knicks' price point is below the asking price for teams open to trading a star player."</p><p>So far this offseason, New York has only made minor moves such as agreeing to an extension with swingman Josh Hart, signing three-and-D specialist Donte DiVincenzo to a contract and trading former first-round pick Obi Toppin to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for draft capital. None of those moves make a significant impact on a team trying to improve on a promising 2022-23 campaign.</p><p>The Knicks finished fifth in the East this season with a 47-35 record and made it to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they fell to the Miami Heat in six games. It was just their second time advancing out of the first round of the playoffs since the 1999-00 season.</p><p>New York is led by star point guard Jalen Brunson, who has two guaranteed seasons remaining on his contract. Begley noted that the Knicks "have a short window to work with if they want to acquire a big salary while Brunson is on his current deal." Superstars like Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Donovan Mitchell were named as players New York is keeping an eye on.</p><p>However, Begley raised a key question: "But waiting on these potential opportunities is a risky move for New York, what if none of them come to fruition?"</p><p>If the Knicks are unable to acquire a star player who is the right fit for them, it will be difficult for them to improve enough to the point where they can contend for a title in the Eastern Conference.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGaFc4KMp5maZaKqurC%2B0maip6GToMButMCvnGaemae6br%2FTmqWcnV2ku2680aKanmWZo3qlrcyimKdlnJ65ra3RnWSjmZ2awG60wKubnqZdqb%2BisMSs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
