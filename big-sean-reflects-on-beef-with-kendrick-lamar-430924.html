He said there were no “real” problems between them to begin with.</p><p></p><p>As most know, rap feuds are part of what makes the genre so entertaining to fans, however, sometimes they become fatal, including the death of legendary artists like Tupac Shakur, The Notorious BIG, and more.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CETF2cwJ7Nt</p><p>Regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendrick Lamar</a>, he hasn’t responded to the news, however, he has laid low over the last couple years following the incredible success of D*MN, which was easily one of the most popular hip-hop records in years.
